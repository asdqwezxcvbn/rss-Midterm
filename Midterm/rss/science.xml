  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For as long as people have been communicating through writing, they have found ways to keep their messages private. Before the invention of the gummed envelope in 1830, securing correspondence involved letterlocking, an ingenious process of folding a flat sheet of paper to become its own envelope, often using a combination of folds, tucks, slits, or adhesives such as sealing wax. Letter writers from Erasmus to Catherine de’ Medici to Emily Dickinson employed these techniques, which Jana Dambrogio, the MIT Libraries’ Thomas F. Peterson (1957) Conservator, has named “letterlocking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The study of letterlocking very consciously bridges humanities and sciences,” says Dambrogio, who first became interested in the practice as a fellow in the conservation studio of the Vatican Apostolic Archives, where she discovered examples from the 15th and 16th centuries. “It draws on the perspectives of not only conservators and historians, but also engineers, imaging experts, and scientists.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Now the rich history of this centuries-old document security technology is the subject of a new book,&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049276/letterlocking/"&gt;Letterlocking: The Hidden History of the Letter&lt;/a&gt;,” published by the MIT Press and co-authored with Daniel Starza Smith, a lecturer in early modern English literature at King’s College London. Dambrogio and Smith have pioneered the field of letterlocking research over the last 10 years, working with an international and interdisciplinary collection of experts, the Unlocking History Research Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With more than 300 images and diagrams, “Letterlocking” explores the practice’s history through real examples from all over the world. It includes a dictionary of 60 technical terms and concepts, systems the authors developed while studying more than 250,000 historic letters. The book aims to be a springboard for new discoveries, whether providing a new lens on history or spurring technological advancements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In working with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2015/mit-libraries-explore-17th-century-postal-archive-signed-sealed-undelivered-1110"&gt;Brienne Collection&lt;/a&gt; — a 17th-century postal trunk full of undelivered letters — the Unlocking History Research Group sought to study intact examples of locked letters without destroying them in the process. This stimulated advances in conservation, radiology, and computational algorithms. In 2020, the team collaborated with researchers from the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), Amanda Ghassaei SM ’17, and Holly Jackson ’22, to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/researchers-virtually-open-sealed-historic-letters-0302"&gt;develop new algorithms&lt;/a&gt; that could virtually read an unopened letter, publishing the results in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Letterlocking” also offers a comprehensive guide to making one’s own locked letters. “The best introduction to letterlocking is to make some models,” says Dambrogio. “Feel the shape and the weight; see how easy it would be to conceal or hard to open without being noticed. We’re inviting people to explore and expand this new field of study through ‘mind and hand.’”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One large metropolis might have several different train systems, from local intercity lines to commuter trains to longer regional lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When designing a system of train tracks, stations, and schedules in this network, should rail operators assume each entity operates independently, seeking only to maximize its own revenue? Or that they fully cooperate all the time with a joint plan, putting their own interest aside?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the real world, neither assumption is very realistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from MIT and ETH Zurich have developed a new planning tool that mixes competition and cooperation to help operators in a complex, multiregional network strategically determine when and how they should work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their framework is unusual because it incorporates co-investment and payoff-sharing mechanisms that identify which joint infrastructure projects a stakeholder should invest in with other operators to maximize collective benefits. The tool can help mobility stakeholders, such as governments, transport agencies, and firms, determine the right time to collaborate, how much they should invest in cooperative projects, how the profits should be distributed, and what would happen if they withdrew from the negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It might seem counterintuitive, but sometimes you want to invest in your opponent so that, at some point, this investment will come back to you. Thanks to game theory, one can formalize this intuition to give rise to an interesting class of problems,” says Gioele Zardini, the Rudge and Nancy Allen Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at MIT, a principal investigator in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS), an affiliate faculty with the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS), and senior author of a paper on this planning framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerical analysis shows that, by investing a portion of their budget into some shared infrastructure projects, independent operators can earn more revenue than if they operated completely noncooperatively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the example of the rail operators, the researchers demonstrate that co-investment also benefits users by improving regional train service. This win-win situation encourages more people to take the train, boosting revenues for operators and reducing emissions from automobiles, says Mingjia He, a graduate student at ETH Zurich and lead author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key point here is that transport network design is not a zero-sum game. One operator’s gain doesn’t have to mean the others’ loss. By shifting the perception from isolated, self-optimization to strategic interaction, cooperation can create greater value for everyone involved,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond transportation, this planning framework could help companies in a crowded industry or governments of neighboring countries test co-investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and Zardini are joined on the paper by ETH Zurich researchers Andrea Censi and Emilio Frazzoli. The research will be presented at the 2025 American Control Conference (ACC), and the paper has been selected as a Student Best Paper Award finalist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mixing cooperation and competition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building transportation infrastructure in a multiregional network typically requires a huge investment of time and resources. Major infrastructure projects have an outsized impact that can stretch far beyond one region or operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each region has its own priorities and decision-makers, such as local transportation authorities, which often results in the failure of coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If local systems are designed separately, regional travel may be more difficult, making the whole system less efficient. But if self-interested stakeholders don’t benefit from coordination, they are less likely to support the plan,” He says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find the best mix of cooperation and competition, the researchers used game theory to build a framework that enables operators to align interests and improve regional cooperation in a way that benefits all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, last year the Swiss government agreed to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.railtech.com/all/2024/10/29/switzerland-to-pay-e50m-to-electrify-network-in-germany/?gdpr=deny" target="_blank"&gt;invest 50 million euros&lt;/a&gt; to electrify and expand part of a regional rail network in Germany, with the goal of creating a faster rail connection between three Swiss cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ planning framework could help independent entities, from regional governments to rail operators, identify when and how to undertake such collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step involves simulating the outcomes if operators don’t collaborate. Then, using the co-investment and payoff-sharing mechanisms, the decision-maker can explore cooperative approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify a fair way to split revenues from shared projects, the researchers design a payoff-sharing mechanism based on a game theory concept known as the Nash bargaining solution. This technique will determine how much benefit operators would receive in different cooperative scenarios, taking into account the benefits they would achieve with no collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The benefits of co-investment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once they had designed the planning framework, the researchers tested it on a simulated transportation network with multiple competing rail operators. They assessed various co-investment ratios across multiple years to identify the best decisions for operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, they found that a semicooperative approach leads to the highest returns for all stakeholders. For instance, in one scenario, by co-investing 50 percent of their total budgets into shared infrastructure projects, all operators maximized their returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another scenario, they show that by investing just 3.3 percent of their total budget in the first year of a multiyear cooperative project, operators can boost outcomes by 30 percent across three metrics: revenue, reduced costs for customers, and lower emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This proves that a small, up-front investment can lead to significant long-term benefits,” He says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they applied their framework to more realistic multiregional networks where all regions weren’t the same size, this semicooperative approach achieved even better results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, their analyses indicate that returns don’t increase in a linear way — sometimes increasing the co-investment ratio does not increase the benefit for operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Success is a multifaceted issue that depends on how much is invested by all operators, which projects are chosen, when investment happens, and how the budget is distributed over time, He explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These strategic decisions are complex, which is why simulations and optimization are necessary to find the best cooperation and negotiation strategies. Our framework can help operators make smarter investment choices and guide them through the negotiation process,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The framework could also be applied to other complex network design problems, such as in communications or energy distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to build a user-friendly interface that will allow a stakeholder to easily explore different collaborative options. They also want to consider more complex scenarios, such as the role policy plays in shared infrastructure decisions or the robust cooperative strategies that handle risks and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was supported, in part, by the ETH Zurich Mobility Initiative and the ETH Zurich Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What if the clothes you wear could care for your health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT researchers have developed an autonomous programmable computer in the form of an elastic fiber, which could monitor health conditions and physical activity, alerting the wearer to potential health risks in real-time. Clothing containing the fiber computer was comfortable and machine washable, and the fibers were nearly imperceptible to the wearer, the researchers report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike on-body monitoring systems known as “wearables,” which are located at a single point like the chest, wrist, or finger, fabrics and apparel have an advantage of being in contact with large areas of the body close to vital organs. As such, they present a unique opportunity to measure and understand human physiology and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fiber computer contains a series of microdevices, including sensors, a microcontroller, digital memory, bluetooth modules, optical communications, and a battery, making up all the necessary components of a computer in a single elastic fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers added four fiber computers to a top and a pair of leggings, with the fibers running along each limb. In their experiments, each independently programmable fiber computer operated a machine-learning model that was trained to autonomously recognize exercises performed by the wearer, resulting in an average accuracy of about 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, once the researchers allowed the individual fiber computers to communicate among themselves, their collective accuracy increased to nearly 95 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our bodies broadcast gigabytes of data through the skin every second in the form of heat, sound, biochemicals, electrical potentials, and light, all of which carry information about our activities, emotions, and health. Unfortunately, most — if not all — of it gets absorbed and then lost in the clothes we wear. Wouldn’t it be great if we could teach clothes to capture, analyze, store, and communicate this important information in the form of valuable health and activity insights?” says Yoel Fink, a professor of materials science and engineering at MIT, a principal investigator in the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE) and the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies (ISN), and senior author of a paper on the research, which &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08568-6" target="_blank"&gt;appears today in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of the fiber computer to understand health conditions and help prevent injury will soon undergo a significant real-world test as well. U.S. Army and Navy service members will be conducting a monthlong winter research mission to the Arctic, covering 1,000 kilometers in average temperatures of -40 degrees Fahrenheit. Dozens of base layer merino mesh shirts with fiber computers will be providing real-time information on the health and activity of the individuals participating on this mission, called Musk Ox II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the not-too-distant future, fiber computers will allow us to run apps and get valuable health care and safety services from simple everyday apparel.&amp;nbsp;We are excited to see glimpses of this future in the upcoming Arctic mission through our partners in the U.S. Army, Navy, and DARPA. Helping to keep our service members safe in the harshest environments is a honor and privilege,” Fink says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is joined on the paper by co-lead authors Nikhil Gupta, an MIT materials science and engineering graduate student; Henry Cheung MEng ’23; and Syamantak Payra ’22, currently a graduate student at Stanford University; John Joannopoulos, the Francis Wright Professor of Physics at MIT and director of the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies; as well as others at MIT, Rhode Island School of Design, and Brown University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiber focus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fiber computer builds on more than a decade of work in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://pbg-rle.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Fibers@MIT&lt;/a&gt; lab at the RLE and was supported primarily by ISN. In&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/programmable-fiber-0603" target="_blank"&gt;previous papers&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers demonstrated methods for incorporating semiconductor devices, optical diodes, memory units, elastic electrical contacts, and sensors into fibers that could be formed into fabrics and garments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But we hit a wall in terms of the complexity of the devices we could incorporate into the fiber because of how we were making it. We had to rethink the whole process. At the same time, we wanted to make it elastic and flexible so it would match the properties of traditional fabrics,” says Gupta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges that researchers surmounted is the geometric mismatch between a cylindrical fiber and a planar chip. Connecting wires to small, conductive areas, known as pads, on the outside of each planar microdevice proved to be difficult and prone to failure because complex microdevices have many pads, making it increasingly difficult to find room to attach each wire reliably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new design, the researchers map the 2D pad alignment of each microdevice to a 3D layout using a flexible circuit board called an interposer, which they wrapped into a cylinder. They call this the “maki” design. Then, they attach four separate wires to the sides of the “maki” roll and connected all the components together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This advance was crucial for us in terms of being able to incorporate higher functionality computing elements, like the microcontroller and Bluetooth sensor, into the fiber,” says Gupta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This versatile folding technique could be used with a variety of microelectronic devices, enabling them to incorporate additional functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the researchers fabricated the new fiber computer using a type of thermoplastic elastomer that is several times more flexible than the thermoplastics they used previously. This material enabled them to form a machine-washable, elastic fiber that can stretch more than 60 percent without failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They fabricate the fiber computer using a thermal draw process that the Fibers@MIT group pioneered in the early 2000s. The process involves creating a macroscopic version of the fiber computer, called a preform, that contains each connected microdevice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This preform is hung in a furnace, melted, and pulled down to form a fiber, which also contains embedded lithium-ion batteries so it can power itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A former group member, Juliette Marion, figured out how to create elastic conductors, so even when you stretch the fiber, the conductors don’t break. We can maintain functionality while stretching it, which is crucial for processes like knitting, but also for clothes in general,” Gupta says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring out the vote&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the fiber computer is fabricated, the researchers use a braiding technique to cover the fiber with traditional yarns, such as polyester, merino wool, nylon, and even silk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to gathering data on the human body using sensors, each fiber computer incorporates LEDs and light sensors that enable multiple fibers in one garment to communicate, creating a textile network that can perform computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each fiber computer also includes a Bluetooth communication system to send data wirelessly to a device like a smartphone, which can be read by a user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers leveraged these communication systems to create a textile network by sewing four fiber computers into a garment, one in each sleeve. Each fiber ran an independent neural network that was trained to identify exercises like squats, planks, arm circles, and lunges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we found is that the ability of a fiber computer to identify human activity was only about 70 percent accurate when located on a single limb, the arms or legs. However, when we allowed the fibers sitting on all four limbs to ‘vote,’ they collectively reached nearly 95 percent accuracy, demonstrating the importance of residing on multiple body areas and forming a network between autonomous fiber computers that does not need wires and interconnects,” Fink says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the researchers want to use the interposer technique to incorporate additional microdevices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arctic insights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, a multinational team equipped with computing fabrics will travel for 30 days and 1,000 kilometers in the Arctic. The fabrics will help keep the team safe, and set the stage for future physiological “digital twinning” models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a leader with more than a decade of Arctic operational experience, one of my main concerns is how to keep my team safe from debilitating cold weather injuries — a primary threat to operators in the extreme cold,” says U.S. Army Major Mathew Hefner, the commander of Musk Ox II. “Conventional systems just don’t provide me with a complete picture.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;We will be wearing the base layer computing fabrics on us 24/7 to help us better understand the body’s response to extreme cold and ultimately predict and prevent injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karl Friedl, U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine senior research scientist of performance physiology, noted that the MIT programmable computing fabric technology may become a “gamechanger for everyday lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Imagine near-term fiber computers in fabrics and apparel that sense and respond to the environment and to the physiological status of the individual, increasing comfort and performance, providing real-time health monitoring and providing protection against external threats.&amp;nbsp;Soldiers will be the early adopters and beneficiaries of this new technology, integrated with AI systems using predictive physiological models and mission-relevant tools to enhance survivability in austere environments,” Friedl says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The convergence of classical fibers and fabrics with computation and machine learning has only begun. We are exploring this exciting future not only through research and field testing, but importantly in an MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering course ‘Computing Fabrics,’ taught with Professor Anais Missakian from the Rhode Island School of Design,” adds Fink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by the U.S. Army Research Office Institute for Soldier Nanotechnology (ISN), the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency, the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Fannie and John Hertz Foundation Fellowship, the Paul and Daisy Soros Foundation Fellowship for New Americans, the Stanford-Knight Hennessy Scholars Program, and the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) has transformed the landscape of water and food research at MIT, driving faculty engagement and catalyzing new research and innovation in these critical areas. With philanthropic, corporate, and government support, J-WAFS’ strategic approach spans the entire research life cycle, from support for early-stage research to commercialization grants for more advanced projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, J-WAFS has invested approximately $25 million in direct research funding to support MIT faculty pursuing transformative research with the potential for significant impact. “Since awarding our first cohort of seed grants in 2015, it’s remarkable to look back and see that over 10 percent of the MIT faculty have benefited from J-WAFS funding,” observes J-WAFS Executive Director Renee J. Robins ’83. “Many of these professors hadn’t worked on water or food challenges before their first J-WAFS grant.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By fostering interdisciplinary collaborations and supporting high-risk, high-reward projects, J-WAFS has amplified the capacity of MIT faculty to pursue groundbreaking research that addresses some of the world’s most pressing challenges facing our water and food systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawing MIT faculty to water and food research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS open calls for proposals enable faculty to explore bold ideas and develop impactful approaches to tackling critical water and food system challenges. Professor Patrick Doyle’s work in water purification exemplifies this impact. “Without J-WAFS, I would have never ventured into the field of water purification,” Doyle reflects. While previously focused on pharmaceutical manufacturing and drug delivery, exposure to J-WAFS-funded peers led him to apply his expertise in soft materials to water purification. “Both the funding and the J-WAFS community led me to be deeply engaged in understanding some of the key challenges in water purification and water security,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Professor Otto Cordero of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) leveraged J-WAFS funding to pivot his research into aquaculture. Cordero explains that his first J-WAFS seed grant “has been extremely influential for my lab because it allowed me to take a step in a new direction, with no preliminary data in hand.” Cordero’s expertise is in microbial communities. He was previous unfamiliar with aquaculture, but he saw the relevance of microbial communities the health of farmed aquatic organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting early-career faculty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New assistant professors at MIT have particularly benefited from J-WAFS funding and support. J-WAFS has played a transformative role in shaping the careers and research trajectories of many new faculty members by encouraging them to explore novel research areas, and in many instances providing their first MIT research grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Ariel Furst reflects on how pivotal J-WAFS’ investment has been in advancing her research. “This was one of the first grants I received after starting at MIT, and it has truly shaped the development of my group’s research program,” Furst explains. With J-WAFS’ backing, her lab has achieved breakthroughs in chemical detection and remediation technologies for water. “The support of J-WAFS has enabled us to develop the platform funded through this work beyond the initial applications to the general detection of environmental contaminants and degradation of those contaminants,” she elaborates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karthish Manthiram, now a professor of chemical engineering and chemistry at Caltech, explains how J-WAFS’ early investment enabled him and other young faculty to pursue ambitious ideas. “J-WAFS took a big risk on us,” Manthiram reflects. His research on breaking the nitrogen triple bond to make ammonia for fertilizer was initially met with skepticism. However, J-WAFS’ seed funding allowed his lab to lay the groundwork for breakthroughs that later attracted significant National Science Foundation (NSF) support. “That early funding from J-WAFS has been pivotal to our long-term success,” he notes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These stories underscore the broad impact of J-WAFS’ support for early-career faculty, and its commitment to empowering them to address critical global challenges and innovate boldly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fueling follow-on funding&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS seed grants enable faculty to explore nascent research areas, but external funding for continued work is usually necessary to achieve the full potential of these novel ideas. “It’s often hard to get funding for early stage or out-of-the-box ideas,” notes J-WAFS Director Professor John H. Lienhard V. “My hope, when I founded J-WAFS in 2014, was that seed grants would allow PIs [principal investigators] to prove out novel ideas so that they would be attractive for follow-on funding. And after 10 years, J-WAFS-funded research projects have brought more than $21 million in subsequent awards to MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Retsef Levi led a seed study on how agricultural supply chains affect food safety, with a team of faculty spanning the MIT schools&amp;nbsp;Engineering and Science as well as the MIT Sloan School of Management. The team parlayed their seed grant research into a multi-million-dollar follow-on initiative. Levi reflects, “The J-WAFS seed funding allowed us to establish the initial credibility of our team, which was key to our success in obtaining large funding from several other agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Des Marais was an assistant professor in the Department of CEE when he received his first J-WAFS seed grant. The funding supported his research on how plant growth and physiology are controlled by genes and interact with the environment. The seed grant helped launch his lab’s work addressing enhancing climate change resilience in agricultural systems. The work led to his Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award from the NSF, a prestigious honor for junior faculty members. Now an associate professor, Des Marais’ ongoing project to further investigate the mechanisms and consequences of genomic and environmental interactions is supported by the five-year, $1,490,000 NSF grant. “J-WAFS providing essential funding to get my new research underway,” comments Des Marais.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stimulating interdisciplinary collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Des Marais’ seed grant was also key to developing new collaborations. He explains, “the J-WAFS grant supported me to develop a collaboration with Professor Caroline Uhler in EECS/IDSS [the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science/Institute for Data, Systems, and Society] that really shaped how I think about framing and testing hypotheses. One of the best things about J-WAFS is facilitating unexpected connections among MIT faculty with diverse yet complementary skill sets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professors A. John Hart of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Benedetto Marelli of CEE also launched a new interdisciplinary collaboration with J-WAFS funding. They partnered to join expertise in biomaterials, microfabrication, and manufacturing, to create printed silk-based colorimetric sensors that detect food spoilage. “The J-WAFS Seed Grant provided a unique opportunity for multidisciplinary collaboration,” Hart notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professors Stephen Graves in the MIT Sloan School of Management and Bishwapriya Sanyal in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP) partnered to pursue new research on agricultural supply chains. With field work in Senegal, their J-WAFS-supported project brought together international development specialists and operations management experts to study how small firms and government agencies influence access to and uptake of irrigation technology by poorer farmers. “We used J-WAFS to spur a collaboration that would have been improbable without this grant,” they explain. Being part of the J-WAFS community also introduced them to researchers in Professor Amos Winter’s lab in the Department of Mechanical Engineering working on irrigation technologies for low-resource settings. DUSP doctoral candidate Mark Brennan notes, “We got to share our understanding of how irrigation markets and irrigation supply chains work in developing economies, and then we got to contrast that with their understanding of how irrigation system models work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timothy Swager, professor of chemistry, and Rohit Karnik, professor of mechanical engineering and J-WAFS associate director, collaborated on a sponsored research project supported by Xylem, Inc. through the J-WAFS Research Affiliate program. The cross-disciplinary research, which targeted the development of ultra-sensitive sensors for toxic PFAS chemicals, was conceived following a series of workshops hosted by J-WAFS. Swager and Karnik were two of the participants, and their involvement led to the collaborative proposal that Xylem funded. “J-WAFS funding allowed us to combine Swager lab’s expertise in sensing with my lab’s expertise in microfluidics to develop a cartridge for field-portable detection of PFAS,” says Karnik. “J-WAFS has enriched my research program in so many ways,” adds Swager, who is now working to commercialize the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving global collaboration and impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS has also helped MIT faculty establish and advance international collaboration and impactful global research. By funding and supporting projects that connect MIT researchers with international partners, J-WAFS has not only advanced technological solutions, but also strengthened cross-cultural understanding and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Matthew Shoulders leads the inaugural J-WAFS Grand Challenge project. In response to the first J-WAFS call for “Grand Challenge” proposals, Shoulders assembled an interdisciplinary team based at MIT to enhance and provide climate resilience to agriculture by improving the most inefficient aspect of photosynthesis, the notoriously-inefficient carbon dioxide-fixing plant enzyme RuBisCO. J-WAFS funded this high-risk/high-reward project following a competitive process that engaged external reviewers through a several rounds of iterative proposal development. The technical feedback to the team led them to researchers with complementary expertise&amp;nbsp;from the Australian National University. “Our collaborative team of biochemists and synthetic biologists, computational biologists, and chemists is deeply integrated with plant biologists and field trial experts, yielding a robust feedback loop for enzyme engineering,” Shoulders says. “Together, this team will be able to make a concerted effort using the most modern, state-of-the-art techniques to engineer crop RuBisCO with an eye to helping make meaningful gains in securing a stable crop supply, hopefully with accompanying improvements in both food and water security.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Leon Glicksman and Research Engineer Eric Verploegen’s team designed a low-cost cooling chamber to preserve fruits and vegetables harvested by smallholder farmers with no access to cold chain storage. J-WAFS’ guidance motivated the team to prioritize practical considerations informed by local collaborators, ensuring market competitiveness. “As our new idea for a forced-air evaporative cooling chamber was taking shape, we continually checked that our solution was evolving in a direction that would be competitive in terms of cost, performance, and usability to existing commercial alternatives,” explains Verploegen, who is currently an MIT D-Lab affiliate. Following the team’s initial seed grant, the team secured a J-WAFS Solutions commercialization grant, which Verploegen say “further motivated us to establish partnerships with local organizations capable of commercializing the technology earlier in the project than we might have done otherwise.” The team has since shared an open-source design as part of its commercialization strategy to maximize accessibility and impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bringing corporate sponsored research opportunities to MIT faculty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS also plays a role in driving private partnerships, enabling collaborations that bridge industry and academia. Through its Research Affiliate Program, for example, J-WAFS provides opportunities for faculty to collaborate with industry on sponsored research, helping to convert scientific discoveries into licensable intellectual property (IP) that companies can turn into commercial products and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS introduced professor of mechanical engineering Alex Slocum to a challenge presented by its research affiliate company, Xylem: how to design a more energy-efficient pump for fluctuating flows. With centrifugal pumps consuming an estimated 6 percent of U.S. electricity annually, Slocum and his then-graduate student Hilary Johnson SM '18, PhD '22 developed an innovative variable volute mechanism that reduces energy usage. “Xylem envisions this as the first in a new category of adaptive pump geometry,” comments Johnson. The research produced a pump prototype and related IP that Xylem is working on commercializing. Johnson notes that these outcomes “would not have been possible without J-WAFS support and facilitation of the Xylem industry partnership.” Slocum adds, “J-WAFS enabled Hilary to begin her work on pumps, and Xylem sponsored the research to bring her to this point … where she has an opportunity to do far more than the original project called for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swager speaks highly of the impact of corporate research sponsorship through J-WAFS on his research and technology translation efforts. His PFAS project with Karnik described above was also supported by Xylem. “Xylem was an excellent sponsor of our research. Their engagement and feedback were instrumental in advancing our PFAS detection technology, now on the path to commercialization,” Swager says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What J-WAFS has accomplished is more than a collection of research projects; a decade of impact demonstrates how J-WAFS’ approach has been transformative for many MIT faculty members. As Professor Mathias Kolle puts it, his engagement with J-WAFS “had a significant influence on how we think about our research and its broader impacts.” He adds that it “opened my eyes to the challenges in the field of water and food systems and the many different creative ideas that are explored by MIT.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This thriving ecosystem of innovation, collaboration, and academic growth around water and food research has not only helped faculty build interdisciplinary and international partnerships, but has also led to the commercialization of transformative technologies with real-world applications. C. Cem Taşan, the POSCO Associate Professor of Metallurgy who is leading a J-WAFS Solutions commercialization team that is about to launch a startup company, sums it up by noting, “Without J-WAFS, we wouldn’t be here at all.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As J-WAFS looks to the future, its continued commitment — supported by the generosity of its donors and partners — builds on a decade of success enabling MIT faculty to advance water and food research that addresses some of the world’s most pressing challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Nicole Estvanik Taylor | Arts at MIT</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Inside MIT’s Zesiger Sports and Fitness Center, on the springy blue mat of the gymnastics room, an unconventional anatomy lesson unfolded during an October meeting of class STS.024/CMS.524 (&lt;a href="https://arts.mit.edu/projects/thinking-on-your-feet/"&gt;Thinking on Your Feet: Dance as a Learning Science&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Supported by a grant from the &lt;a href="http://arts.mit.edu/cast"&gt;MIT Center for Art, Science &amp;amp; Technology&lt;/a&gt; (CAST), Thinking on Your Feet was developed and offered for the first time in Fall 2024 by &lt;a href="https://sts-program.mit.edu/people/sts-faculty/jennifer-s-light/"&gt;Jennifer S. Light&lt;/a&gt;, the Bern Dibner Professor of the History of Science and Technology and a professor of Urban Studies and Planning. Light’s vision for the class included a varied lineup of guest instructors. During the last week of October, she handed the reins to Middlebury College Professor Emerita Andrea Olsen, whose expertise bridges dance and science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Olsen organized the class into small groups. Placing hands on each other’s shoulders conga-line style, participants shuffled across the mat personifying the layers of the nervous system as Olsen had just explained them: the supportive spinal cord and bossy brain of the central nervous system; the sympathetic nervous system responsible for fight-or-flight and its laid-back parasympathetic counterpart; and the literal “gut feelings” of the enteric nervous system. The groups giggled and stumbled as they attempted to stay in character and coordinate their movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Unusual as this exercise was, it perfectly suited a class dedicated to movement as a tool for teaching and learning. One of the class’s introductory readings, an excerpt from Annie Murphy Paul’s book “The Extended Mind,” suggests why this was a more effective primer on the nervous system than a standard lecture: “Our memory for what we have&amp;nbsp;heard is remarkably weak. Our memory for what we have&amp;nbsp;done, however — for physical actions we have undertaken — is much more robust.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Head-to-toe education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Thinking on Your Feet is the third course spun out from Light’s Project on Embodied Education (the other two, developed in collaboration with MIT Director of Physical Education and Wellness Carrie Sampson Moore, examine the history of exercise in relation to schools and medicine, respectively). A historian of science and technology and historian of education for much of her career, Light refocused her scholarship on movement and learning after she’d begun training at Somerville’s Esh Circus Arts to counteract the stress of serving as department head. During her sabbatical a few years later, as part of Esh’s pre-professional program for aspiring acrobats, she took a series of dance classes spanning genres from ballet to hip-hop to Afro modern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I started playing with the idea that this is experiential learning — could I bring something like this back to MIT?” she recalls. “There’s a ton of interesting contemporary scientific research on cognition and learning as not just neck-up processes, but whole-body processes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Thinking on Your Feet provides an overview of recent scientific studies indicating the surprising extent to which physical activity enhances attention, memory, executive function, and other aspects of mental acuity. Other readings consider dance’s role in the transmission of knowledge throughout human history — from the Native Hawaiian tradition of hula to early forms of ballet in European courts — and describe the ways movement-based instruction can engage underserved populations and neurodiverse learners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“You can argue for embodied learning on so many dimensions,” says Light. “I want my students to understand that what they’ve been taught about learning is only part of the story, and that contemporary science, ancient wisdom, and non-Western traditions all have a lot to tell us about how we might rethink education to maximize the benefits for all different kinds of students.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning to dance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If you scan the new class’s syllabus, you’re unlikely to miss the word “fun.” It appears twice — bolded, in all caps, and garnished by an exclamation point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I’m trying to bring a playful, experimental, ‘you don’t have to be perfect, just be creative’ vibe,” says Light. A dance background is not a prerequisite. The 18 students who registered this fall ranged from experienced dancers to novices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I initially took this class just to fulfill my arts requirement,” admits junior physics major Matson Garza, one of the latter group. He was surprised at how much he enjoyed it. “I have an interest in physics education, and I’ve found that beyond introductory courses it’s often lacking intuition. Integrating movement may be one way to solve this problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Similarly, second-year biological engineering major Annabel Tiong found her entry point through an interest in hands-on education, deepened after volunteering with a program that aims to spark curiosity about health-care careers by engaging kids in medical simulations. “While I don’t have an extensive background in dance,” she says, “I was curious how dance, with its free-form and creative nature, could be used to teach STEM topics that appear to be quite concrete and technical.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To build on each Tuesday’s lectures and discussions, Thursday “lab” sessions focused on overcoming inhibitions, teaching different styles of movement, and connecting dance with academic content. McKersin of Lakaï Arts, a lecturer in dance for the MIT Music and Theater Arts section, led a lab on Haitian harvest dances; Guy Steele PhD ’80 and Clark Baker SM ’80 of the MIT Tech Squares club provided an intro to square dancing and some of its connections to math and programming. Light invited some of her own dance instructors from the circus community, including Johnny Blazes, who specializes (according to their website) in working with “people who have been told implicitly and explicitly that they don’t belong in movement and fitness spaces.” Another, Reba Rosenberg, led the students through basic partner acrobatics that Light says did wonders for the class’s sense of confidence and community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Afterwards, several students asked, ‘Could we do this again?’” remembers Light. “None of them thought they could do the thing that by the end of class they were able to do: balance on each other, stand on each other. You can imagine how the need to physically trust someone with your safety yields incredible benefits when we’re back in the classroom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dancing to learn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The culmination of Thinking on Your Feet — a final project constituting 40 percent of students’ grades — required each student to create a dance-based lesson plan on a STEM topic of their choice. Students were exposed throughout the semester to examples of such pedagogy. Olsen’s nervous-system parade was one. Others came courtesy of Lewis Hou of Science Ceilidh, an organization that uses Scottish highland dance to illustrate concepts across the natural and physical sciences, and MIT alumna Yamilée Toussaint ’08, whose nonprofit STEM from Dance helps young women of color create performances with technical components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As a stepping stone, Light had planned a midterm assignment asking students to adapt existing choreography. But her students surprised her by wanting to jump directly into creating their own dances from scratch. Those first forays weren’t elaborate, but Light was impressed enough by their efforts that she plans to amend the syllabus accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“One group was doing differential calculus and imagining the floor as a graph,” she recalls, “having dancers think about where they were in relation to each other.” Another group, comprising members of the MIT Ballroom Dance team, choreographed the computer science concept of pipelined processors. “They were giving commands to each other like ‘load’ and ‘execute’ and ‘write back,’” Light says. “The beauty of this is that the students could offer each other feedback on the technical piece of it. Like, ‘OK, I see that you’re trying to explain a clock cycle. Maybe try to do it this way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Among the pipelined processing team was senior Kateryna Morhun, a competitive ballroom dancer since age 4 who is earning her degree in artificial intelligence and decision-making. “We wanted to challenge ourselves to teach a specialized, more technical topic that isn’t usually a target of embodied learning initiatives,” Morhun says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;How useful can dance really be in teaching advanced academic content? This was a lively topic of debate among the Thinking on Your Feet cohort. It’s a question Light intends to investigate further with mechanical engineering lecturer Benita Comeau, who audited the class and offered a lab exploring the connections among dance, physics, and martial arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“This class sparked many ideas for me, across multiple subject matters and movement styles,” says Comeau. “As an example, the square dance class reminded me of the symmetry groups that are used to describe molecular symmetry in chemistry, and it occurred to me that students could move through symmetry groups and learn about chirality” — a geometric property relevant to numerous branches of science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For their final presentation, Garza and Tiong’s group tackled substitution mechanisms, a topic from organic chemistry (“notoriously viewed as a very difficult and dreaded class,” according to their write-up). Their lesson plan specified that learners would first need to familiarize themselves with key points through conventional readings and discussion. But then, to bring that material alive, groups of learners representing atoms would take the floor. One, portraying a central carbon atom, would hold out an arm indicating readiness to accept an electron. Another would stand to the side with two balls representing electrons, bonded by a ribbon. Others would rotate in a predetermined order around the central carbon to portray a model’s initial stereochemistry. And so a dance would begin: a three-dimensional, human-scale visualization of a complex chemical process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The group was asked to summarize what they hoped learners would discover through their dance. “Chemistry is very dynamic!” they wrote. “It’s not mixing chemicals to magically make new ones — it’s a dynamic process of collision, bonding, and molecule-breaking that causes some structures to vanish and others to appear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In addition to evaluating the impact of movement in her classes in collaboration with Raechel Soicher from the MIT Teaching + Learning Lab, Light is working on a book about how modern science has rediscovered the ancient wisdom of embodied learning. She hopes her class will kick off a conversation at MIT about incorporating such movement-assisted insights into the educational practices of the future. In fact, she believes MIT’s heritage of innovative pedagogy makes it ripe for these explorations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As her syllabus puts it: “For all of us, as part of the MIT community, this class invites us to reconsider how our ‘mind and hand’ approach to experiential learning — a product of the 19th century — might be expanded to ‘mind and body’ for the 21st century.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;During a meeting of class 6.C40/24.C40 (Ethics of Computing), Professor&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/"&gt;Armando Solar-Lezama&lt;/a&gt; poses the same impossible question to his students that he often asks himself in the research he leads with the Computer Assisted Programming Group at MIT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"How do we make sure that a machine does what we want, and only what we want?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;At this moment, what some consider the golden age of generative AI, this may seem like an urgent new question. But Solar-Lezama, the Distinguished Professor of Computing at MIT, is quick to point out that this struggle is as old as humankind itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He begins to retell the Greek myth of King Midas, the monarch who was granted the godlike power to transform anything he touched into solid gold. Predictably, the wish backfired when Midas accidentally turned everyone he loved into gilded stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"Be careful what you ask for because it might be granted in ways you don't expect," he says, cautioning his students, many of them aspiring mathematicians and programmers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Digging into MIT archives to share slides of grainy black-and-white photographs, he narrates the history of programming. We hear about the 1970s Pygmalion machine that required incredibly detailed cues, to the late '90s computer software that took teams of engineers years and an 800-page document to program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While remarkable in their time, these processes took too long to reach users. They left no room for spontaneous discovery, play, and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Solar-Lezama talks about the risks of building modern machines that don't always respect a programmer's cues or red lines, and that are equally capable of exacting harm as saving lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Titus Roesler, a senior majoring in electrical engineering, nods knowingly. Roesler is writing his final paper on the ethics of autonomous vehicles and weighing who is morally responsible when one hypothetically hits and kills a pedestrian. His argument questions underlying assumptions behind technical advances, and considers multiple valid viewpoints. It leans on the philosophy theory of utilitarianism. Roesler explains, "Roughly, according to utilitarianism, the moral thing to do brings about the most good for the greatest number of people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT philosopher&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://web.mit.edu/bskow/www/"&gt;Brad Skow&lt;/a&gt;, with whom Solar-Lezama developed and is team-teaching the course, leans forward and takes notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A class that demands technical and philosophical expertise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ethics of Computing, offered for the first time in Fall 2024, was created through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/common-ground-for-computing-education/"&gt;Common Ground for Computing Education&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing that brings multiple departments together to develop and teach new courses and launch new programs that blend computing with other disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The instructors alternate lecture days. Skow, the Laurance S. Rockefeller Professor of Philosophy, brings his discipline's lens for examining the broader implications of today's ethical issues, while Solar-Lezama, who is also the associate director and chief operating officer of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, offers perspective through his.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Skow and Solar-Lezama attend one another's lectures and adjust their follow-up class sessions in response. Introducing the element of learning from one another in real time has made for more dynamic and responsive class conversations. A recitation to break down the week's topic with graduate students from philosophy or computer science and a lively discussion combine the course content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"An outsider might think that this is going to be a class that will make sure that these new computer programmers being sent into the world by MIT always do the right thing," Skow says. However, the class is intentionally designed to teach students a different skill set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Determined to create an impactful semester-long course that did more than lecture students about right or wrong, philosophy professor Caspar Hare conceived the idea for Ethics of Computing in his role as an associate dean of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/"&gt;Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing&lt;/a&gt;. Hare recruited Skow and Solar-Lezama as the lead instructors, as he knew they could do something more profound than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"Thinking deeply about the questions that come up in this class requires both technical and philosophical expertise. There aren't other classes at MIT that place both side-by-side,” Skow says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That's exactly what drew senior Alek Westover to enroll. The math and computer science double major explains, "A lot of people are talking about how the trajectory of AI will look in five years. I thought it was important to take a class that will help me think more about that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Westover says he's drawn to philosophy because of an interest in ethics and a desire to distinguish right from wrong. In math classes, he's learned to write down a problem statement and receive instant clarity on whether he's successfully solved it or not. However, in Ethics of Computing, he has learned how to make written arguments for "tricky philosophical questions" that may not have a single correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For example, "One problem we could be concerned about is, what happens if we build powerful AI agents that can do any job a human can do?" Westover asks. "If we are interacting with these AIs to that degree, should we be paying them a salary? How much should we care about what they want?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There's no easy answer, and Westover assumes he'll encounter many other dilemmas in the workplace in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“So, is the internet destroying the world?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The semester began with a deep dive into AI risk, or the notion of "whether AI poses an existential risk to humanity," unpacking free will, the science of how our brains make decisions under uncertainty, and debates about the long-term liabilities, and regulation of AI. A second, longer unit zeroed in on "the internet, the World Wide Web, and the social impact of technical decisions." The end of the term looks at privacy, bias, and free speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One class topic was devoted to provocatively asking: "So, is the internet destroying the world?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Senior Caitlin Ogoe is majoring in Course 6-9 (Computation and Cognition). Being in an environment where she can examine these types of issues is precisely why the self-described "technology skeptic" enrolled in the course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Growing up with a mom who is hearing impaired and a little sister with a developmental disability, Ogoe became the default family member whose role it was to call providers for tech support or program iPhones. She leveraged her skills into a part-time job fixing cell phones, which paved the way for her to develop a deep interest in computation, and a path to MIT. However, a prestigious summer fellowship in her first year made her question the ethics behind how consumers were impacted by the technology she was helping to program.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"Everything I've done with technology is from the perspective of people, education, and personal connection," Ogoe says. "This is a niche that I love. Taking humanities classes around public policy, technology, and culture is one of my big passions, but this is the first course I've taken that also involves a philosophy professor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The following week, Skow lectures on the role of bias in AI, and Ogoe, who is entering the workforce next year, but plans to eventually attend law school to focus on regulating related issues, raises her hand to ask questions or share counterpoints four times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Skow digs into examining COMPAS, a controversial AI software that uses an algorithm to predict the likelihood that people accused of crimes would go on to re-offend. According to a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm"&gt;2018 ProPublica article&lt;/a&gt;, COMPAS was likely to flag Black defendants as future criminals and gave false positives at twice the rate as it did to white defendants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The class session is dedicated to determining whether the article warrants the conclusion that the COMPAS system is biased and should be discontinued. To do so, Skow introduces two different theories on fairness:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"Substantive fairness is the idea that a particular outcome might be fair or unfair," he explains. "Procedural fairness is about whether the procedure by which an outcome is produced is fair." A variety of conflicting criteria of fairness are then introduced, and the class discusses which were plausible, and what conclusions they warranted about the COMPAS system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Later on, the two professors go upstairs to Solar-Lezama's office to debrief on how the exercise had gone that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"Who knows?" says Solar-Lezama. "Maybe five years from now, everybody will laugh at how people were worried about the existential risk of AI. But one of the themes I see running through this class is learning to approach these debates beyond media discourse and getting to the bottom of thinking rigorously about these issues."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <description><![CDATA[How the late Woodie Flowers helped create a new foundation for “the MIT way” of teaching.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When the late professor emeritus Woodie Flowers SM ’68, MEng ’71, PhD ’73 was a student at MIT, most of his classes involved paper-and-pencil exercises with predetermined solutions. Flowers had an affinity for making things, and for making them work. When he transitioned from student to teacher, he chose to carry this approach into his method of instruction and, in doing so, he helped change the way engineering students are educated — at MIT, and around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/Professor-Emeritus-Woodie-Flowers-dies-75-1014"&gt;Flowers passed away in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but his legacy lives on, and the magnitude of the educational revolution he helped to evolve was profound&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, Flowers took over instruction of 2.70, now called class 2.007 (Design and Manufacturing I). The&amp;nbsp;capstone course is one that many first-year students today look forward to taking, but that wasn’t always the case. Before Flowers took over instruction, class instruction relied heavily on chalkboard demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their idea of design at the time was to draw drawings of parts,” explains Professor Emeritus David Gossard PhD ’75, Flowers’ longtime friend and colleague. “Woody had a different idea. Give the entire class a kit of materials [and] a common goal, which was to build a machine — to climb a hill, or pick up golf balls, or whatever it did — and make a contest out of it. It was a phenomenal success. The kids loved it, the faculty loved it, the Institute loved it. And over a period of years, it became, I think it's fair to say, an institution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Flowers at the lead, 2.70 transformed into a project-based, get-your-hands-dirty, robotics-competition-focused experience. By all accounts, he also made the experience incredibly fun — something he valued in his own life. He was fond of skydiving and was often seen rollerblading through the Infinite Corridor. The course, informed by his unique style, was at the forefront of a revolution in engineering education, and it quickly helped solidify the Department of Mechanical Engineering’s reputation for innovative education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of kids had never started from scratch and built anything,” Flowers once told &lt;em&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt;. His advisor, Robert Mann, had similar beliefs in a hands-on, modern pedagogy. Building on Mann’s philosophy, and incorporating his own approach, Flowers breathed new life and provided a new foundation for “the MIT way” of teaching. This was a reinvigoration at the right place and the right time that ultimately had a global butterfly effect on the popularity of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) instruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over the years lectures had displaced the hands-on stuff, and Woodie brought it back,” says Sanjay Sarma, the Fred Fort Flowers (1941) and Daniel Fort Flowers (1941) Professor in Mechanical Engineering.&amp;nbsp;“I can’t think of a single person to have impacted the field of robotics and design in undergraduate, or high school, education as much as Woodie.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flowers became interested in mechanical engineering and design at a young age, thanks in large part to his parents. His father was a welder with a penchant for tinkering, inventing, and building, his mother was an elementary school teacher. Flowers grew up taking things apart and putting them back together — an activity which he seemed to believe made students better engineers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking in 2010 with&lt;em&gt; InfiniteMIT&lt;/em&gt;, a digital archive of Institute history made possible by the generosity of Jane and A. Neil Pappalardo ’64,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://infinite.mit.edu/video/woodie-c-flowers-sm-68-me-71-phd-73"&gt;Flowers shared a story&lt;/a&gt; about a student who had accepted the task in her group of finding out whether a piece of reinforcement steel rebar could be bent into a tight loop and serve as a bearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She came into lab and I was there early, and she had a slightly bent piece of rebar. It had been heated — you could tell that it had been hot, and she was going to report that she really can’t do that, it just kind of doesn’t work,” Flowers recalled. He suggested they try another approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We went out in the lab and I found another big steel bar and I found the biggest vice I could find,” he continued. Flowers cranked the rebar down against the piece of steel he was going to wrap it around, then took a four-pound sledgehammer to it. “My father had a blacksmith pit, so that was familiar to me. I wrapped [the rebar around the steel and] made a fine bearing. As I finish the last blow, I looked up and three of the best students in the class — really sharp people — were standing there with their jaw open. They’d never seen anyone hit a piece of steel hard enough to just mold it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He continued, “that visceral understanding of the behavior of mechanics is really important. It doesn’t fall out of the sky and it certainly doesn’t come out of a textbook, it comes through real interaction. I believe I had been so lucky because when I encountered Castiglione’s theorem about deflection of materials, it kind of made sense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Course 2.70/2.007 is considered a landmark class in engineering education. It was one of the first hands-on classes to teach students not only how to design an object, but also how to build it and, by demonstrating the value of practical, project-based learning and robotics competitions, it has influenced the approach taken by many other programs. Today, it continues to develop students’ competence and self-confidence as design engineers, with an emphasis on the creative design process bolstered by application of physical laws, robustness, and manufacturability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the course also served as the inspiration for development of the FIRST Robotics program, which Flowers and inventor Dean Kamen started in 1989. FIRST has programs for preschool through high school students and, to date, more than 3.2 million youth from more than 100 countries have participated in FIRST competitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, the parts kit — or as Flowers fondly referred to it, the “bag of junk” — included things like springs, tongue depressors, and rubber bands.&amp;nbsp;Flowers’ wife Margaret recalls spending many nights packing these kits and hosting advisees in their home. “We considered ourselves a team,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, in addition to using the kit of mechanical parts and materials, students in 2.007 might develop 3D printed components, and they incorporate electronics in their robots for an autonomous portion of the final competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spring 2024 competition, themed after Cartoon Network’s popular animated science fiction sitcom “Rick and Morty,” featured a spaceship that students’ robots could interact with for points, vats of “acid” where balls could be collected and placed in tubes, and game pieces that paid homage to iconic episodes. The final task required the robot to travel up an elevator and send a character down a zipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, other themes have centered on tasks related to stories ranging from “Star Wars” to&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;“Back to the Future”&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and “Wakanda Forever.” The 2022 theme, however, may have been the most poignant theme to date: “Legacy,” a celebration of Flowers’ life and work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Woodie] revealed, unambiguously, that designing, fabricating, assembling and building things was fun,” says Gossard. “It was arguably the essence of engineering. There was joy in it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article appears in the Spring 2025 issue of MechE Connects, the magazine of the MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the story goes, the Scottish inventor James Watt envisioned how steam engines should work on one day in 1765, when he was walking across Glasgow Green, a park in his hometown. Watt realized that putting a separate condenser in an engine would allow its main cylinder to remain hot, making the engine more efficient and compact than the huge steam engines then in existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet Watt, who had been pondering the problem for a while, needed a partnership with entrepreneur Matthew Boulton to get a practical product to market, starting in 1775 and becoming successful in later years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People still use this story of Watt’s ‘Eureka!’ moment, which Watt himself promoted later in his life,” says MIT Professor David Mindell, an engineer and historian of science and engineering. “But it took 20 years of hard labor, during which Watt struggled to support a family and had multiple failures, to get it out in the world. Multiple other inventions were required to achieve what we today call product-market fit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full story of the steam engine, Mindell argues, is a classic case of what is today called “process innovation,” not just “product innovation.” Inventions are rarely fully-formed products, ready to change the world. Mostly, they need a constellation of improvements, and sustained persuasion, to become adopted into industrial systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was true for Watt still holds, as Mindell’s body of work shows. Most technology-driven growth today comes from overlapping advances, when inventors and companies tweak and improve things over time. Now, Mindell explores those ideas in a forthcoming book, “&lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049528/the-new-lunar-society/" target="_blank"&gt;The New Lunar Society: An Enlightenment Guide to the Next Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt;,” being published on Feb. 24 by the MIT Press.&amp;nbsp;Mindell is professor of aeronautics and astronautics and the Dibner Professor of the History of Engineering and Manufacturing at MIT, where he has also co-founded the Work of the Future initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve overemphasized product innovation, although we’re very good at it,” Mindell says. “But it’s become apparent that process innovation is just as important: how you improve the making, fixing, rebuilding, or upgrading of systems. These are deeply entangled. Manufacturing is part of process innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, with so many things being positioned as world-changing products, it may be especially important to notice that being adaptive and persistent is practically the essence of improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Young innovators don’t always realize that when their invention doesn’t work at first, they’re at the start of a process where they have to refine and engage, and find the right partners to grow,” Mindell says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manufacturing at home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title of Mindell’s book refers to British Enlightenment thinkers and inventors — Watt was one of them — who used to meet in a group they called the Lunar Society, centered in Birmingham. This included pottery innovator Josiah Wedgewood; physician Erasmus Darwin; chemist Joseph Priestley; and Boulton, a metal manufacturer whose work and capital helped make Watt’s improved steam engine a reliable product. The book moves between chapters on the old Lunar Society and those on contemporary industrial systems, drawing parallels between then and now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The stories about the Lunar Society are models for the way people can go about their careers, engineering or otherwise, in a way they may not see in popular press about technology today,” Mindell says. “Everyone told Wedgwood he couldn’t compete with Chinese porcelain, yet he learned from the Lunar Society and built an English pottery industry that led the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying the Lunar Society’s virtues to contemporary industry leads Mindell to a core set of ideas about technology. Research shows that design and manufacturing should be adjacent if possible, not outsourced globally, to accelerate learning and collaboration. The book also argues that technology should address human needs and that venture capital should focus more on industrial systems than it does. (Mindell has co-founded a firm, called Unless, that invests in companies by using venture financing structures better-suited to industrial transformation.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In seeing a new industrialism&amp;nbsp;taking shape, Mindell suggests that&amp;nbsp;its future includes&amp;nbsp;new ways of working, collaborating, and&amp;nbsp;valuing knowledge throughout organizations, as well as more AI-based open-source tools for small and mid-size manufacturers. He also contends that a new industrialism should include greater emphasis on maintenance and repair work, which are valuable sources of knowledge about industrial devices and systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve undervalued how to keep things running, while simultaneously hollowing out the middle of the workforce,” he says. “And yet, operations and maintenance are sites of product innovation. Ask the person who fixes your car or dishwasher. They’ll tell you the strengths and weaknesses of every model.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All told, “The sum total of this work, over time, amounts to a new industrialism if it elevates its cultural status into a movement that values the material basis of our lives and seeks to improve it, literally from the ground up,” Mindell writes in the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The book doesn’t predict the future,” he says. “But rather it suggests how to talk about the future of industry with optimism and realism, as opposed to saying, this is the utopian future where machines do everything, and people just sit back in chairs with wires coming out of their heads.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work of the Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The New Lunar Society” is a concise book with expansive ideas. Mindell also devotes chapters to the convergence of the Industrial-era Enlightenment, the founding of the U.S., and the crucial role of industry in forming the republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only founding father who signed all of the critical documents in the founding of the country, Benjamin Franklin, was also the person who crystallized the modern science of electricity and deployed its first practical invention, the lightning rod,” Mindell says. “But there were multiple figures, including Thomas Jefferson and Paul Revere, who integrated the industrial Enlightenment with democracy. Industry has been core to American democracy from the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as Mindell emphasizes in the book, “industry,” beyond evoking smokestacks, has a human meaning: If you are hard-working, you are displaying industry. That meshes with the idea of persistently redeveloping an invention over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the high regard Mindell holds for the Industrial Enlightenment, he recognizes that the era’s industrialization brought harsh working conditions, as well as environmental degradation. As one of the co-founders of MIT’s Work of the Future initiative, he argues that 21st-century industrialism needs to rethink some of its fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ideals of [British] industrialization missed on the environment, and missed on labor,” Mindell says. “So at this point, how do we rethink industrial systems to do better?” Mindell argues that industry must power an economy that grows while decarbonizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, Mindell adds, “About 70 percent of greenhouse gas emissions are from industrial sectors, and all of the potential solutions involve making lots of new stuff. Even if it’s just connectors and wire. We’re not going to decarbonize or address global supply chain crises by deindustrializing, we’re going to get there by reindustrializing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The New Lunar Society” has received praise from technologists and other scholars. Joel Mokyr, an economic historian at Northwestern University who coined the term “Industrial Enlightenment,” has stated that Mindell “realizes that innovation requires a combination of knowing and making, mind and hand. … He has written a deeply original and insightful book.”&amp;nbsp;Jeff Wilke SM ’93, a former CEO of Amazon’s consumer business, has said the book “argues compellingly that a thriving industrial base, adept at both product and process innovation, underpins a strong democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mindell hopes the audience for the book will range from younger technologists to a general audience of anyone interested in the industrial future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think about young people in industrial settings and want to help them see they’re part of a great tradition and are doing important things to change the world,” Mindell says. “There is a huge audience of people who are interested in technology but find overhyped language does not match their aspirations or personal experience. I’m trying to crystallize this new industrialism as a way of imagining and talking about the future.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;From crafting complex code to revolutionizing the hiring process, generative artificial intelligence is reshaping industries faster than ever before — pushing the boundaries of creativity, productivity, and collaboration across countless domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://genai.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Generative AI Impact Consortium&lt;/a&gt;, a collaboration between industry leaders and MIT’s top minds. As MIT President Sally Kornbluth highlighted last year, the Institute is poised to address the societal impacts of generative AI through bold collaborations. Building on this momentum and established through MIT’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/mit-generative-ai-week-fosters-dialogue-across-disciplines-1211"&gt;Generative AI Week&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/preprints-of-generative-ai-impact-papers-publish-through-mit-presss-mit-open-publishing-services-mitops/" target="_blank"&gt;impact papers&lt;/a&gt;, the consortium aims to harness AI’s transformative power for societal good, tackling challenges before they shape the future in unintended ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Generative AI and large language models [LLMs] are reshaping everything, with applications stretching across diverse sectors,” says Anantha Chandrakasan, dean of the School of Engineering and MIT’s chief innovation and strategy officer, who leads the consortium. “As we push forward with newer and more efficient models, MIT is committed to guiding their development and impact on the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chandrakasan adds that the consortium’s vision is rooted in MIT’s core mission. “I am thrilled and honored to help advance one of President Kornbluth’s strategic priorities around artificial intelligence,” he says. “This initiative is uniquely MIT — it thrives on breaking down barriers, bringing together disciplines, and partnering with industry to create real, lasting impact. The collaborations ahead are something we’re truly excited about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing the blueprint for generative AI’s next leap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consortium is guided by three pivotal questions, framed by Daniel Huttenlocher, dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and co-chair of the GenAI Dean’s oversight group, that go beyond AI’s technical capabilities and into its potential to transform industries and lives:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can AI-human collaboration create outcomes that neither could achieve alone?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the dynamic between AI systems and human behavior, and how do we maximize the benefits while steering clear of risks?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can interdisciplinary research guide the development of better, safer AI technologies that improve human life?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generative AI continues to advance at lightning speed, but its future depends on building a solid foundation. “Everybody recognizes that large language models will transform entire industries, but there's no strong foundation yet around design principles,” says&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/tim-kraska" target="_blank"&gt;Tim Kraska&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and co-faculty director of the consortium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now is a perfect time to look at the fundamentals — the building blocks that will make generative AI more effective and safer to use,” adds Kraska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What excites me is that this consortium isn’t just academic research for the distant future — we’re working on problems where our timelines align with industry needs, driving meaningful progress in real time," says&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/vivek-f-farias" target="_blank"&gt;Vivek F. Farias&lt;/a&gt;, the Patrick J. McGovern (1959) Professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, and co-faculty director of the consortium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A “perfect match” of academia and industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the Generative AI Impact Consortium are six founding members: Analog Devices, The Coca-Cola Co., OpenAI, Tata Group, SK Telecom, and TWG Global.&amp;nbsp;Together, they will work hand-in-hand with MIT researchers to accelerate breakthroughs and address industry-shaping problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consortium taps into MIT’s expertise, working across schools and disciplines — led by MIT’s Office of Innovation and Strategy, in collaboration with the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and all five of MIT’s schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This initiative is the ideal bridge between academia and industry,” says Chandrakasan. “With companies spanning diverse sectors, the consortium brings together real-world challenges, data, and expertise. MIT researchers will dive into these problems to develop cutting-edge models and applications into these different domains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry partners: Collaborating on AI’s evolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of the consortium’s mission is collaboration — bringing MIT researchers and industry partners together to unlock generative AI’s potential while ensuring its benefits are felt across society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the founding members is OpenAI, the creator of the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This type of collaboration between academics, practitioners, and labs is key to ensuring that generative AI evolves in ways that meaningfully benefit society,” says Anna Makanju, vice president of global impact at OpenAI, adding that OpenAI “is eager to work alongside MIT’s Generative AI Consortium to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and the real-world expertise of diverse industries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coca-Cola Co. recognizes an opportunity to leverage AI innovation on a global scale.&amp;nbsp;“We see a tremendous opportunity to innovate at the speed of AI and, leveraging The Coca-Cola Company's global footprint, make these cutting-edge solutions accessible to everyone,” says Pratik Thakar, global vice president and head of generative AI. “Both MIT and The Coca-Cola Company are deeply committed to innovation, while also placing equal emphasis on the legally and ethically responsible development and use of technology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For TWG Global, the consortium offers the ideal environment to share knowledge and drive advancements. “The strength of the consortium is its unique combination of industry leaders and academia, which fosters the exchange of valuable lessons, technological advancements, and access to pioneering research,” says Drew Cukor, head of data and artificial intelligence transformation. Cukor adds that TWG Global “is keen to share its insights and actively engage with leading executives and academics to gain a broader perspective of how others are configuring and adopting AI, which is why we believe in the work of the consortium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tata Group views the collaboration as a platform to address some of AI’s most pressing challenges. “The consortium enables Tata to collaborate, share knowledge, and collectively shape the future of generative AI, particularly in addressing urgent challenges such as ethical considerations, data privacy, and algorithmic biases,” says Aparna Ganesh, vice president of Tata Sons Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, SK Telecom sees its involvement as a launchpad for growth and innovation. Suk-geun (SG) Chung, SK Telecom executive vice president and chief AI global officer, explains, “Joining the consortium presents a significant opportunity for SK Telecom to enhance its AI competitiveness in core business areas, including AI agents, AI semiconductors, data centers (AIDC), and physical AI,” says Chung. “By collaborating with MIT and leveraging the SK AI R&amp;amp;D Center as a technology control tower, we aim to forecast next-generation generative AI technology trends, propose innovative business models, and drive commercialization through academic-industrial collaboration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Lee, chief technology officer of Analog Devices (ADI), highlights how the consortium bridges key knowledge gaps for both his company and the industry at large. “ADI can’t hire a world-leading expert in every single corner case, but the consortium will enable us to access top MIT researchers and get them involved in addressing problems we care about, as we also work together with others in the industry towards common goals,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consortium will host interactive workshops and discussions to identify and prioritize challenges. “It’s going to be a two-way conversation, with the faculty coming together with industry partners, but also industry partners talking with each other,” says&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/georgia-perakis" target="_blank"&gt;Georgia Perakis&lt;/a&gt;, the John C Head III Dean (Interim) of the MIT Sloan School of Management and professor of operations management, operations research and statistics, who serves alongside Huttenlocher as co-chair of the GenAI Dean’s oversight group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparing for the AI-enabled workforce of the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With AI poised to disrupt industries and create new opportunities, one of the consortium’s core goals is to guide that change in a way that benefits both businesses and society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the first commercial digital computers were introduced [the UNIVAC&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/univac-computer-dedicated" target="_blank"&gt;was delivered&lt;/a&gt; to the U.S. Census Bureau in&amp;nbsp;1951], people were worried about losing their jobs,” says Kraska. “And yes, jobs like large-scale, manual data entry clerks and human ‘computers,’ people tasked with doing manual calculations, largely disappeared over time. But the people impacted by those first computers were trained to do other jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consortium aims to play a key role in preparing the workforce of tomorrow by educating global business leaders and employees on generative AI evolving uses and applications. With the pace of innovation accelerating, leaders face a flood of information and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it comes to educating leaders about generative AI, it’s about helping them navigate the complexity of the space right now, because there’s so much hype and hundreds of papers published daily,” says Kraska. “The hard part is understanding which developments could actually have a chance of changing the field and which are just tiny improvements. There's a kind of FOMO [fear of missing out] for leaders that we can help reduce.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defining success: Shared goals for generative AI impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Success within the initiative is defined by shared progress, open innovation, and mutual growth. “Consortium participants recognize, I think, that when I share my ideas with you, and you share your ideas with me, we’re both fundamentally better off,” explains Farias. “Progress on generative AI is not zero-sum, so it makes sense for this to be an open-source initiative.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While participants may approach success from different angles, they share a common goal of advancing generative AI for broad societal benefit. “There will be many success metrics,” says Perakis. “We’ll educate students, who will be networking with companies. Companies will come together and learn from each other. Business leaders will come to MIT and have discussions that will help all of us, not just the leaders themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Analog Devices’ Alan Lee, success is measured in tangible improvements that drive efficiency and product innovation: “For us at ADI, it’s a better, faster quality of experience for our customers, and that could mean better products. It could mean faster design cycles, faster verification cycles, and faster tuning of equipment that we already have or that we’re going to develop for the future. But beyond that, we want to help the world be a better, more efficient place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganesh highlights success through the lens of real-world application. “Success will also be defined by accelerating AI adoption within Tata companies, generating actionable knowledge that can be applied in real-world scenarios, and delivering significant advantages to our customers and stakeholders,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generative AI is no longer confined to isolated research labs — it’s driving innovation across industries and disciplines. At MIT, the technology has become a campus-wide priority, connecting researchers, students, and industry leaders to solve complex challenges and uncover new opportunities. “It's truly an MIT initiative,” says Farias, “one that’s much larger than any individual or department on campus.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <description><![CDATA[MIT study finds a diversified portfolio of carbon dioxide removal options delivers the best return on investment.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Mark Dwortzan | Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Last year the Earth exceeded &lt;a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/2024-track-be-first-year-exceed-15oc-above-pre-industrial-average" target="_blank"&gt;1.5 degrees Celsius&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of warming above preindustrial times, a threshold beyond which wildfires, droughts, floods, and other climate impacts are expected to escalate in frequency, intensity, and lethality. To cap global warming at 1.5 C and avert that scenario, the nearly 200 signatory nations of the &lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement"&gt;Paris Agreement&lt;/a&gt; on climate change will &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_TechnicalSummary.pdf#page=69"&gt;need to not only dramatically lower their greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt;, but also take measures to remove carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from the atmosphere and durably store it at or below the Earth’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past analyses of the climate mitigation potential, costs, benefits, and drawbacks of different &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/outreach/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Factsheet_CDR.pdf"&gt;carbon dioxide removal&lt;/a&gt; (CDR) options have focused primarily on three strategies: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), in which CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-absorbing plant matter is converted into fuels or directly burned to generate energy, with some of the plant’s carbon content captured and then stored safely and permanently; afforestation/reforestation, in which CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-absorbing trees are planted in large numbers; and direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), a technology that captures and separates CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; directly from ambient air, and injects it into geological reservoirs or incorporates it into durable products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To provide a more comprehensive and actionable analysis of CDR, a new study by researchers at the &lt;a href="https://cs3.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy&lt;/a&gt; (CS3) first expands the option set to include biochar (charcoal produced from plant matter and stored in soil) and enhanced weathering (EW) (spreading finely ground rock particles on land to accelerate storage of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in soil and water). The study then evaluates portfolios of all five options — in isolation and in combination — to assess their capability to meet the 1.5 C goal, and their potential impacts on land, energy, and policy costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ada4c0"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; appears in the journal &lt;em&gt;Environmental Research Letters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;Aided by their global multi-region, multi-sector Economic Projection and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, the MIT CS3 researchers produce three key findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the most cost-effective, low-impact strategy that policymakers can take to achieve global net-zero emissions — an essential step in meeting the 1.5 C goal — is to diversify their CDR portfolio, rather than rely on any single option. This approach minimizes overall cropland and energy consumption, and negative impacts such as increased food insecurity and decreased energy supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By diversifying across multiple CDR options, the highest CDR deployment of around 31.5 gigatons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year is achieved in 2100, while also proving the most cost-effective net-zero strategy. The study identifies BECCS and biochar as most cost-competitive in removing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere, followed by EW, with DACCS as uncompetitive due to high capital and energy requirements. While posing logistical and other challenges, biochar and EW have the potential to improve soil quality and productivity across 45 percent of all croplands by 2100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diversifying CDR portfolios is the most cost-effective net-zero strategy because it avoids relying on a single CDR option, thereby reducing and redistributing negative impacts on agriculture, forestry, and other land uses, as well as on the energy sector,” says &lt;a href="https://www.carma-chair.com/post-doctoral-program-solene-chiquier"&gt;Solene Chiquier&lt;/a&gt;, lead author of the study who was a CS3 postdoc during its preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second finding: There is no optimal CDR portfolio that will work well at global and national levels. The ideal CDR portfolio for a particular region will depend on local technological, economic, and geophysical conditions. For example, afforestation and reforestation would be of great benefit in places like Brazil, Latin America, and Africa, by not only sequestering carbon in more acreage of protected forest but also helping to preserve planetary well-being and human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In designing a sustainable, cost-effective CDR portfolio, it is important to account for regional availability of agricultural, energy, and carbon-storage resources,” says &lt;a href="https://cs3.mit.edu/about-us/personnel/paltsev-sergey"&gt;Sergey Paltsev&lt;/a&gt;, CS3 deputy director, &lt;a href="https://energy.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Energy Initiative&lt;/a&gt; senior research scientist, and supervising co-author of the study. “Our study highlights the need for enhancing knowledge about local conditions that favor some CDR options over others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the MIT CS3 researchers show that delaying large-scale deployment of CDR portfolios could be very costly, leading to considerably higher carbon prices across the globe — a development sure to deter the climate mitigation efforts needed to achieve the 1.5 C goal. They recommend near-term implementation of policy and financial incentives to help fast-track those efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT.nano has announced seven new companies to join START.nano, a program aimed at speeding the transition of hard-tech innovation to market. The program supports new ventures through discounted use of MIT.nano’s facilities and access to the MIT innovation ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advancements pursued by the newly engages startups include wearables for health care, green alternatives to fossil fuel-based energy, novel battery technologies, enhancements in data systems, and interconnecting nanofabrication knowledge networks, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The transition of the grand idea that is imagined in the laboratory to something that a million people can use in their hands is a journey fraught with many challenges,” MIT.nano Director Vladimir Bulović said at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mitnano.mit.edu/events/nano-summit-2024" target="_blank"&gt;2024 Nano Summit&lt;/a&gt;, where nine START.nano companies presented their work. The program provides resources to ease startups over the first two hurdles — finding stakeholders and building a well-developed prototype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to access to laboratory tools necessary to advance their technologies, START.nano companies receive advice from MIT.nano expert staff, are connected to MIT.nano Consortium companies, gain a broader exposure at MIT conferences and community events, and are eligible to join the MIT Startup Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MIT.nano has allowed us to push our project to the frontiers of sensing by implementing advanced fabrication techniques using their machinery,” said Uroš Kuzmanović, CEO and founder of Biosens8. “START.nano has surrounded us with exciting peers, a strong support system, and a spotlight to present our work. By taking advantage of all that the program has to offer, BioSens8 is moving faster than we could anywhere else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the seven new START.nano participants:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.analogphotonics.com/home/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analog Photonics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;is developing lidar and optical communications technology using silicon photonics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biosens8.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biosens8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is engineering novel devices to enable health ownership. Their research focuses on multiplexed wearables for hormones, neurotransmitters, organ health markers, and drug use that will give insight into the body's health state, opening the door to personalized medicine and proactive, data-driven health decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://casimirspace.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Casimir, Inc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;is working on power-generating nanotechnology that interacts with quantum fields to create a continuous source of power. The team compares their technology to a solar panel that works in the dark or a battery that never needs to be recharged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://centralspiral.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Central Spiral&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; focuses on lossless data compression. Their technology allows for the compression of any type of data, including those that are already compressed, reducing data storage and transmission costs, lowering carbon dioxide emissions, and enhancing efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fabublox.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FabuBlox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; connects stakeholders across the nanofabrication ecosystem and resolves issues of scattered, unorganized, and isolated fab knowledge. Their cloud-based platform combines a generative process design and simulation interface with GitHub-like repository building capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.metal-fuels.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metal Fuels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is converting industrial waste aluminum to onsite energy and high-value aluminum/aluminum-oxide powders. Their approach combines existing mature technologies of molten metal purification and water atomization to develop a self-sustaining reactor that produces alumina of higher value than our input scrap aluminum feedstock, while also collecting the hydrogen off-gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polyjoule.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PolyJoule, Inc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an energy storage startup working on conductive polymer battery technology. The team’s goal is a grid battery of the future that is ultra-safe, sustainable, long living, and low-cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the seven startups that are actively using MIT.nano, nine other companies have been invited to join the latest START.nano cohort:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acorn Genetics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;American Boronite Corp.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Copernic Catalysts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Envoya Bio&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Helix Carbon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minerali&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plaid Semiconductors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quantum Network Technologies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wober Tech&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched in 2021, START.nano now comprises &lt;a href="https://mitnano.mit.edu/startnano/ventures"&gt;over 20 companies and eight graduates&lt;/a&gt; — ventures that have moved beyond the initial startup stages and some into commercialization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>The multifaceted challenge of powering AI</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence has become vital in business and financial dealings, medical care, technology development, research, and much more. Without realizing it, consumers rely on AI when they stream a video, do online banking, or perform an online search. Behind these capabilities are more than 10,000 data centers globally, each one a huge warehouse containing thousands of computer servers and other infrastructure for storing, managing, and processing data. There are now over 5,000 data centers in the United States, and new ones are being built every day — in the U.S. and worldwide. Often dozens are clustered together right near where people live, attracted by policies that provide tax breaks and other incentives, and by what looks like abundant electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And data centers do consume huge amounts of electricity.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;U.S. data centers consumed more than 4 percent of the country’s total electricity in 2023, and by 2030 that fraction could rise to 9 percent, according to the Electric Power Research Institute. A single large data center can consume as much electricity as 50,000 homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sudden need for so many data centers presents a massive challenge to the technology and energy industries, government policymakers, and everyday consumers. Research scientists and faculty members at the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI) are exploring multiple facets of this problem — from sourcing power to grid improvement to analytical tools that increase efficiency, and more. Data centers have quickly become the energy issue of our day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexpected demand brings unexpected solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;companies that use data centers to provide cloud computing and data management services are announcing some surprising steps to deliver all that electricity. Proposals include building their own small nuclear plants near their data centers and even restarting one of the undamaged nuclear reactors at Three Mile Island, which has been shuttered since 2019. (A different reactor at that plant partially melted down in 1979, causing the nation’s worst nuclear power accident.) Already the need to power AI is causing delays in the planned shutdown of some coal-fired power plants and raising prices for residential consumers. Meeting the needs of data centers is not only stressing power grids, but also setting back the transition to clean energy needed to stop climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many aspects to the data center problem from a power perspective. Here are some that MIT researchers are focusing on, and why they’re important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An unprecedented surge in the demand for electricity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the past, computing was not a significant user of electricity,” says William H. Green, director of MITEI and the Hoyt C. Hottel Professor in the MIT Department of Chemical Engineering. “Electricity was used for running industrial processes and powering household devices such as air conditioners and lights, and more recently for powering heat pumps and charging electric cars. But now all of a sudden, electricity used for computing in general, and by data centers in particular, is becoming a gigantic new demand that no one anticipated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why the lack of foresight? Usually, demand for electric power increases by roughly half-a-percent per year, and utilities bring in new power generators and make other investments as needed to meet the expected new demand. But the data centers now coming online are creating unprecedented leaps in demand that operators didn’t see coming. In addition, the new demand is constant. It’s critical that a data center provides its services all day, every day. There can be no interruptions in processing large datasets, accessing stored data, and running the cooling equipment needed to keep all the packed-together computers churning away without overheating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, even if enough electricity is generated, getting it to where it’s needed may be a problem, explains Deepjyoti Deka, a MITEI research scientist. “A grid is a network-wide operation, and the grid operator may have sufficient generation at another location or even elsewhere in the country, but the wires may not have sufficient capacity to carry the electricity to where it’s wanted.” So transmission capacity must be expanded — and, says Deka, that’s a slow process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the “interconnection queue.” Sometimes, adding either a new user (a “load”) or a new generator to an existing grid can cause instabilities or other problems for everyone else already on the grid. In that situation, bringing a new data center online may be delayed. Enough delays can result in new loads or generators having to stand in line and wait for their turn. Right now, much of the interconnection queue is already filled up with new solar and wind projects. The delay is now about five years. Meeting the demand from newly installed data centers while ensuring that the quality of service elsewhere is not hampered is a problem that needs to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding clean electricity sources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further complicate the challenge, many companies — including so-called “hyperscalers” such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon — have made public commitments to having net-zero carbon emissions within the next 10 years. Many have been making strides toward achieving their clean-energy goals by buying “power purchase agreements.” They sign a contract to buy electricity from, say, a solar or wind facility, sometimes providing funding for the facility to be built. But that approach to accessing clean energy has its limits when faced with the extreme electricity demand of a data center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, soaring power consumption is delaying coal plant closures in many states. There are simply not enough sources of renewable energy to serve both the hyperscalers and the existing users, including individual consumers. As a result, conventional plants fired by fossil fuels such as coal are needed more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the hyperscalers look for sources of clean energy for their data centers, one option could be to build their own wind and solar installations. But such facilities would generate electricity only intermittently. Given the need for uninterrupted power, the data center would have to maintain energy storage units, which are expensive. They could instead rely on natural gas or diesel generators for backup power — but those devices would need to be coupled with equipment to capture the carbon emissions, plus a nearby site for permanently disposing of the captured carbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of such complications, several of the hyperscalers are turning to nuclear power. As Green notes, “Nuclear energy is well matched to the demand of data centers, because nuclear plants can generate lots of power reliably, without interruption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a much-publicized move in September, Microsoft signed a deal to buy power for 20 years after Constellation Energy reopens one of the undamaged reactors at its now-shuttered nuclear plant at Three Mile Island, the site of the much-publicized nuclear accident in 1979. If approved by regulators, Constellation will bring that reactor online by 2028, with Microsoft buying all of the power it produces. Amazon also reached a deal to purchase power produced by another nuclear plant threatened with closure due to financial troubles. And in early December, Meta released a request for proposals to identify nuclear energy developers to help the company meet their AI needs and their sustainability goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other nuclear news focuses on small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), factory-built, modular power plants that could be installed near data centers, potentially without the cost overruns and delays often experienced in building large plants. Google recently ordered a fleet of SMRs to generate the power needed by its data centers. The first one will be completed by 2030 and the remainder by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some hyperscalers are betting on new technologies. For example, Google is pursuing next-generation geothermal projects, and Microsoft has signed a contract to purchase electricity from a startup’s fusion power plant beginning in 2028 — even though the fusion technology hasn’t yet been demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing electricity demand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other approaches to providing sufficient clean electricity focus on making the data center and the operations it houses more energy efficient so as to perform the same computing tasks using less power. Using faster computer chips and optimizing algorithms that use less energy are already helping to reduce the load, and also the heat generated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another idea being tried involves shifting computing tasks to times and places where carbon-free energy is available on the grid. Deka explains: “If a task doesn’t have to be completed immediately, but rather by a certain deadline, can it be delayed or moved to a data center elsewhere in the U.S. or overseas where electricity is more abundant, cheaper, and/or cleaner? This approach is known as ‘carbon-aware computing.’” We’re not yet sure whether every task can be moved or delayed easily, says Deka. “If you think of a generative AI-based task, can it easily be separated into small tasks that can be taken to different parts of the country, solved using clean energy, and then be brought back together? What is the cost of doing this kind of division of tasks?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach is, of course, limited by the problem of the interconnection queue. It’s difficult to access clean energy in another region or state. But efforts are under way to ease the regulatory framework to make sure that critical interconnections can be developed more quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the neighbors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major concern running through all the options for powering data centers is the impact on residential energy consumers. When a data center comes into a neighborhood, there are not only aesthetic concerns but also more practical worries. Will the local electricity service become less reliable? Where will the new transmission lines be located? And who will pay for the new generators, upgrades to existing equipment, and so on? When new manufacturing facilities or industrial plants go into a neighborhood, the downsides are generally offset by the availability of new jobs. Not so with a data center, which may require just a couple dozen employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are standard rules about how maintenance and upgrade costs are shared and allocated. But the situation is totally changed by the presence of a new data center. As a result, utilities now need to rethink their traditional rate structures so as not to place an undue burden on residents to pay for the infrastructure changes needed to host data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIT’s contributions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At MIT, researchers are thinking about and exploring a range of options for tackling the problem of providing clean power to data centers. For example, they are investigating architectural designs that will use natural ventilation to facilitate cooling, equipment layouts that will permit better airflow and power distribution, and highly energy-efficient air conditioning systems based on novel materials. They are creating new analytical tools for evaluating the impact of data center deployments on the U.S. power system and for finding the most efficient ways to provide the facilities with clean energy. Other work looks at how to match the output of small nuclear reactors to the needs of a data center, and how to speed up the construction of such reactors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT teams also focus on determining the best sources of backup power and long-duration storage, and on developing decision support systems for locating proposed new data centers, taking into account the availability of electric power and water and also regulatory considerations, and even the potential for using what can be significant waste heat, for example, for heating nearby buildings. Technology development projects include designing faster, more efficient computer chips and more energy-efficient computing algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing leadership and funding for many research projects, MITEI is acting as a convenor, bringing together companies and stakeholders to address this issue.&amp;nbsp;At MITEI’s 2024 Annual Research Conference, a panel of representatives from&amp;nbsp;two hyperscalers and two companies that design and construct data centers together discussed their challenges, possible solutions, and where MIT research could be most beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As data centers continue to be built, and computing continues to create an unprecedented increase in demand for electricity, Green says, scientists and engineers are in a race to provide the ideas, innovations, and technologies that can meet this need, and at the same time continue to advance the transition to a decarbonized energy system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Michaela Jarvis | MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amid the benefits that algorithmic decision-making and artificial intelligence offer — including revolutionizing speed, efficiency, and predictive ability in a vast range of fields — Manish Raghavan is working to mitigate associated risks, while also seeking opportunities to apply the technologies to help with preexisting social concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I ultimately want my research to push towards better solutions to long-standing societal problems,” says Raghavan, the Drew Houston Career Development Professor who is a shared faculty member between the MIT Sloan School of Management and the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, as well as a principal investigator at the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good example of Raghavan’s intention can be found in his exploration of the use AI in hiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raghavan says, “It’s hard to argue that hiring practices historically have been particularly good or worth preserving, and tools that learn from historical data inherit all of the biases and mistakes that humans have made in the past.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, however, Raghavan cites a potential opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s always been hard to measure discrimination,” he says, adding, “AI-driven systems are sometimes easier to observe and measure than humans, and one goal of my work is to understand how we might leverage this improved visibility to come up with new ways to figure out when systems are behaving badly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area with parents who both have computer science degrees, Raghavan says he originally wanted to be a doctor. Just before starting college, though, his love of math and computing called him to follow his family example into computer science. After spending a summer as an undergraduate doing research at Cornell University with Jon Kleinberg, professor of computer science and information science, he decided he wanted to earn his PhD there, writing his thesis on “The Societal Impacts of Algorithmic Decision-Making.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raghavan won awards for his work, including a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships Program award, a Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship, and the Cornell University Department of Computer Science PhD Dissertation Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, he joined the MIT faculty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps hearkening back to his early interest in medicine, Raghavan has done research on whether the determinations of a highly accurate algorithmic screening tool used in triage of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, known as the Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS), are improved with complementary expert physician advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The GBS is roughly as good as humans on average, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t individual patients, or small groups of patients, where the GBS is wrong and doctors are likely to be right,” he says. “Our hope is that we can identify these patients ahead of time so that doctors’ feedback is particularly valuable there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raghavan has also worked on how online platforms affect their users, considering how social media algorithms observe the content a user chooses and then show them more of that same kind of content. The difficulty, Raghavan says, is that users may be choosing what they view in the same way they might grab bag of potato chips, which are of course delicious but not all that nutritious. The experience may be satisfying in the moment, but it can leave the user feeling slightly sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raghavan and his colleagues have developed a model of how a user with conflicting desires — for immediate gratification versus a wish of longer-term satisfaction — interacts with a platform. The model demonstrates how a platform’s design can be changed to encourage a more wholesome experience. The model won the Exemplary Applied Modeling Track Paper Award at the 2022 Association for Computing Machinery Conference on Economics and Computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Long-term satisfaction is ultimately important, even if all you care about is a company’s interests,” Raghavan says. “If we can start to build evidence that user and corporate interests are more aligned, my hope is that we can push for healthier platforms without needing to resolve conflicts of interest between users and platforms. Of course, this is idealistic. But my sense is that enough people at these companies believe there’s room to make everyone happier, and they just lack the conceptual and technical tools to make it happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding his process of coming up with ideas for such tools and concepts for how to best apply computational techniques, Raghavan says his best ideas come to him when he’s been thinking about a problem off and on for a time. He would advise his students, he says, to follow his example of putting a very difficult problem away for a day and then coming back to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Things are often better the next day,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he's not puzzling out a problem or teaching, Raghavan can often be found outdoors on a soccer field, as a coach of the Harvard Men’s Soccer Club, a position he cherishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can’t procrastinate if I know I’ll have to spend the evening at the field, and it gives me something to look forward to at the end of the day,” he says. “I try to have things in my schedule that seem at least as important to me as work to put those challenges and setbacks into context.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Raghavan considers how to apply computational technologies to best serve our world, he says he finds the most exciting thing going on his field is the idea that AI will open up new insights into “humans and human society.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping,” he says, “that we can use it to better understand ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sites.mit.edu/vijayg/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vijay Gadepally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a senior staff member at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, leads a number of projects at the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/about/facilities/lincoln-laboratory-supercomputing-center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (LLSC) to make computing platforms, and the artificial intelligence systems that run on them, more efficient. Here, Gadepally discusses the increasing use of generative AI in everyday tools, its hidden environmental impact, and some of the ways that Lincoln Laboratory and the greater AI community can reduce emissions for a greener future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What trends are you seeing in terms of how generative AI is being used in computing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Generative AI uses machine learning (ML) to create new content, like images and text, based on data that is inputted into the ML system. At the LLSC we design and build some of the largest academic computing platforms in the world, and over the past few years we've seen an explosion in the number of projects that need access to high-performance computing for generative AI. We're also seeing how generative AI is changing all sorts of fields and domains — for example, ChatGPT is already influencing the classroom and the workplace faster than regulations can seem to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can imagine all sorts of uses for generative AI within the next decade or so, like powering highly capable virtual assistants, developing new drugs and materials, and even improving our understanding of basic science. We can't predict everything that generative AI will be used for, but I can certainly say that with more and more complex algorithms, their compute, energy, and climate impact will continue to grow very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What strategies is the LLSC using to mitigate this climate impact?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;We're always looking for ways to make &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/ai-models-are-devouring-energy-tools-reduce-consumption-are-here-if-data-centers-will-adopt"&gt;computing more efficient&lt;/a&gt;, as doing so helps our data center make the most of its resources and allows our scientific colleagues to push their fields forward in as efficient a manner as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one example, we've been reducing the amount of power our hardware consumes by making simple changes, similar to dimming or turning off lights when you leave a room. In one experiment, we reduced the energy consumption of a group of graphics processing units by 20 percent to 30 percent, with minimal impact on their performance, by enforcing a &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3620678.3624793"&gt;power cap&lt;/a&gt;. This technique also lowered the hardware operating temperatures, making the GPUs easier to cool and longer lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another strategy is changing our behavior to be more climate-aware. At home, some of us might choose to use renewable energy sources or intelligent scheduling. We are using similar techniques at the LLSC — such as training AI models when temperatures are cooler, or when local grid energy demand is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also realized that a lot of the energy spent on computing is often wasted, like how a water leak increases your bill but without any benefits to your home. We developed some new techniques that allow us to monitor computing workloads as they are running and then terminate those that are unlikely to yield good results. Surprisingly, in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00740-3"&gt;a number of cases&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;we found that the majority of computations could be terminated early &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12419"&gt;without compromising the end result&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What's an example of a project you've done that reduces the energy output of a generative AI program?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;We recently built a climate-aware computer vision tool. Computer vision is a domain that's focused on applying AI to images; so, differentiating between cats and dogs in an image, correctly labeling objects within an image, or looking for components of interest within an image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our tool, we included real-time carbon telemetry, which produces information about how much carbon is being emitted by our local grid as a model is running. Depending on this information, our system will automatically switch to a more energy-efficient version of the model, which typically has fewer parameters, in times of high carbon intensity, or a much higher-fidelity version of the model in times of low carbon intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By doing this, we saw a nearly &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3581784.3607034"&gt;80 percent reduction in carbon emissions&lt;/a&gt; over a one- to two-day period. We recently &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12900"&gt;extended this idea&lt;/a&gt; to other generative AI tasks such as text summarization and found the same results. Interestingly, the performance sometimes improved after using our technique!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What can we do as consumers of generative AI to help mitigate its climate impact?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;As consumers, we can ask our AI providers to offer greater transparency. For example, on Google Flights, I can see a variety of options that indicate a specific flight's carbon footprint. We should be getting similar kinds of measurements from generative AI tools so that we can make a conscious decision on which product or platform to use based on our priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can also make an effort to be more educated on generative AI emissions in general. Many of us are familiar with vehicle emissions, and it can help to talk about generative AI emissions in comparative terms. People may be surprised to know, for example, that one image-generation task is &lt;a href="https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.1215/"&gt;roughly equivalent&lt;/a&gt; to driving four miles in a gas car, or that it takes the same amount of energy to charge an electric car as it does to generate about 1,500 text summarizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many cases where customers would be happy to make a trade-off if they knew the trade-off's impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What do you see for the future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Mitigating the climate impact of generative AI is one of those problems that people all over the world are working on, and with a similar goal. We're doing a lot of work here at Lincoln Laboratory, but its only scratching at the surface. In the long term, data centers, AI developers, and energy grids will need to work together to provide "energy audits" to uncover other unique ways that we can improve computing efficiencies. We need more partnerships and more collaboration in order to forge ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you're interested in learning more, or collaborating with Lincoln Laboratory on these efforts, please contact&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:vijayg@mit.edu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vijay Gadepally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>New filter captures and recycles aluminum from manufacturing waste</title>

        <dc:creator>Jennifer Chu | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Used in everything from soda cans and foil wrap to circuit boards and rocket boosters, aluminum is the second-most-produced metal in the world after steel. By the end of this decade, demand is projected to drive up aluminum production by 40 percent worldwide. This steep rise will magnify aluminum’s environmental impacts, including any pollutants that are released with its manufacturing waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT engineers have developed a new nanofiltration process to curb the hazardous waste generated from aluminum production. Nanofiltration could potentially be used to process the waste from an aluminum plant and retrieve any aluminum ions that would otherwise have escaped in the effluent stream. The captured aluminum could then be upcycled and added to the bulk of the produced aluminum, increasing yield while simultaneously reducing waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers demonstrated the membrane’s performance in lab-scale experiments using a novel membrane to filter various solutions that were similar in content to the waste streams produced by aluminum plants. They found that the membrane selectively captured more than 99 percent of aluminum ions in these solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If scaled up and implemented in existing production facilities, the membrane technology could reduce the amount of wasted aluminum and improve the environmental quality of the waste that plants generate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This membrane technology not only cuts down on hazardous waste but also enables a circular economy for aluminum by reducing the need for new mining,” says John Lienhard,&amp;nbsp;the Abdul Latif Jameel Professor of Water in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, and director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) at MIT. “This offers a promising solution to address environmental concerns while meeting the growing demand for aluminum.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lienhard and his colleagues report their results in a study &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c07268" target="_blank"&gt;appearing today in the journal&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The study’s co-authors include MIT mechanical engineering undergraduates Trent Lee and Vinn&amp;nbsp;Nguyen, and Zi&amp;nbsp;Hao&amp;nbsp;Foo SM ’21, PhD ’24, who is a postdoc at the University of California at Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A recycling niche&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lienhard’s group at MIT develops membrane and filtration technologies for desalinating seawater and remediating various sources of wastewater. In looking for new areas to apply their work, the team found an unexplored opportunity in aluminum and, in particular, the wastewater generated from the metal’s production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of aluminum’s production, metal-rich ore, called bauxite, is first mined from open pits, then put through a series of chemical reactions to separate the aluminum from the rest of the mined rock. These reactions ultimately produce aluminum oxide, in a powdery form called alumina. Much of this alumina is then shipped to refineries, where the powder is poured into electrolysis vats containing a molten mineral called cryolite. When a strong electric current is applied, cryolite breaks alumina’s chemical bonds, separating aluminum and oxygen atoms. The pure aluminum then settles in liquid form to the bottom of the vat, where it can be collected and cast into various forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cryolite electrolyte acts as a solvent, facilitating the separation of alumina during the molten salt electrolysis process. Over time, the cryolite accumulates impurities such as sodium, lithium, and potassium ions — gradually reducing its effectiveness in dissolving alumina. At a certain point, the concentration of these impurities reaches a critical level, at&amp;nbsp;which the electrolyte must be replaced with fresh cryolite to main process efficiency. The spent cryolite, a viscous sludge containing residual aluminum ions and impurities, is then transported away for disposal.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We learned that for a traditional aluminum plant, something like 2,800 tons of aluminum are wasted per year,” says lead author Trent Lee, who carried out the new work as part of the MITEI Energy UROP program. “We were looking at ways that the industry can be more efficient, and we found cryolite waste hadn’t been well-researched in terms of recycling some of its waste products.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A charged kick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new work, the researchers aimed to develop a membrane process to filter cryolite waste and recover aluminum ions that inevitably make it into the waste stream. Specifically, the team looked to capture aluminum while letting through all other ions, especially sodium, which builds up significantly in the cryolite over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team reasoned that if they could selectively capture aluminum from cryolite waste, the aluminum could be poured back into the electrolysis vat without adding excessive sodium that would further slow the electrolysis process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ new design is an adaptation of membranes used in conventional water treatment plants. These membranes are typically made from a thin sheet of polymer material that is perforated by tiny, nanometer-scale pores, the size of which is tuned to let through specific ions and molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surface of conventional membranes carries a natural, negative charge. As a result, the membranes repel any ions that carry the same negative charge, while they attract positively charged ions to flow through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with the Japanese membrane company Nitto Denko, the MIT team sought to examine the efficacy of commercially available membranes that could filter through most positively charged ions in cryolite wastewater while repelling and capturing aluminum ions. However, aluminum ions also carry a positive charge, of +3, where sodium and the other cations carry a lesser positive charge of +1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motivated by the group’s recent work investigating membranes for recovering lithium from salt lakes and spent batteries, the team tested a novel Nitto Denko membrane with a thin, positively charged coating covering the membrane. The coating’s charge is just positive enough to strongly repel and retain aluminum while allowing less positively charged ions to flow through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The aluminum is the most positively charged of the ions, so most of it is kicked away from the membrane,” Foo explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tested the membrane’s performance by passing through solutions with various balances of ions, similar to what can be found in cryolite waste. They observed that the membrane consistently captured 99.5 percent of aluminum ions while allowing through sodium and the other cations. They also varied the pH of the solutions, and found the membrane maintained its performance even after sitting in highly acidic solution for several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of this cryolite waste stream comes at different levels of acidity,” Foo says. “And we found the membrane works really well, even within the harsh conditions that we would expect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new experimental membrane is about the size of a playing card. To treat cryolite waste in an industrial-scale aluminum production plant, the researchers envision a scaled-up version of the membrane, similar to what is used in many desalination plants, where a long membrane is rolled up in a spiral configuration, through which water flows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This paper shows the viability of membranes for innovations in circular economies,” Lee says. “This membrane provides the dual benefit of upcycling aluminum while reducing hazardous waste.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Loren R. Graham, professor emeritus of the history of science who served on the MIT faculty for nearly three decades, died on Dec. 15, 2024, at the age of 91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham received a BS in chemical engineering from Purdue University in 1955, the same year his classmate, acquaintance, and future NASA astronaut and moon walker Neil Armstrong graduated with a BS in aeronautical engineering. Graham went on to earn a PhD in history in 1964 from Columbia University, where he taught from 1965 until 1978.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1978, Graham joined the MIT Program in Science, Technology, and Society (STS) as a professor of the history of science. His specialty during his tenure with the program was in the history of science in Russia and the Soviet Union in the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. His work focused on Soviet and Marxist philosophy of science and science politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of Graham’s career spanned the Cold War. He participated in one of the first academic exchange programs between the United States and the Soviet Union from 1960 to 1961 and marched in the Moscow May Day Parade just weeks after Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space. In 1965, he received a Fulbright Award to do research in the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham wrote extensively on the influence of social context in science and the study of contemporary science and technology in Russia. He also experimented in writing a nonfiction mystery, “Death in the Lighthouse”&amp;nbsp;(2013),&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and making documentary films. His publications include “Science, Philosophy and Human Behavior in the Soviet Union” (1987), “Science and the Soviet Social Order” (1990), “Science in Russia and the Soviet Union: A Short History” (1993), “The Ghost of the Executed Engineer” (1993); “A Face in the Rock” (1995); and “What Have We Learned About Science and Technology from the Russian Experience?”&amp;nbsp;(1998).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His publication “Science, Philosophy and Science in the Soviet Union” was nominated for the National Book Award in 1987. He received the George Sarton Medal from the History of Science Society in 1996 and the Follo Award of the Michigan Historical Society in 2000 for his contributions to Michigan history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many former colleagues recall the impact he had at MIT. In 1988, with fellow faculty member Merritt Roe Smith, professor emeritus of history, he played a leading role in establishing the graduate program in the history and social study of science and technology that is now known as HASTS. This interdisciplinary graduate Program in History, Anthropology, and Science, Technology, and Society has become one of the most selective graduate programs at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Loren was an intellectual innovator and role model for teaching and advising,” says Sherry Turkle, MIT professor of sociology. “And he was a wonderful colleague. … He experimented. He had fun. He cared about writing and about finding joy in work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham served on the STS faculty until his retirement in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout his life, Graham was a member of many foundations and honorary societies, including the U.S. Civilian Research and Development Foundation, the American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Russian Academy of Natural Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was also a member on several boards of trustees, including George Soros' International Science Foundation, which supported Russian scientists after the collapse of the Soviet Union. For many years he served on the board of trustees of the European University at St. Petersburg, remaining an active member on its development board until 2024.

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Frida Polli, a neuroscientist, entrepreneur, investor, and inventor known for her leading-edge contributions at the crossroads of behavioral science and artificial intelligence, is MIT’s new visiting innovation scholar for the 2024-25 academic year. She is the first visiting innovation scholar to be housed within the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polli began her career in academic neuroscience with a focus on multimodal brain imaging related to health and disease. She was a fellow at the Psychiatric Neuroimaging Group at Mass General Brigham and Harvard Medical School. She then joined the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT as a postdoc, where she worked with John Gabrieli, the Grover Hermann Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and a professor of brain and cognitive sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her research has won many awards, including a Young Investigator Award from the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation. She authored over 30 peer-reviewed articles, with notable publications in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Brain&lt;/em&gt;. She transitioned from academia to entrepreneurship by completing her MBA at the Harvard Business School (HBS) as a Robert Kaplan Life Science Fellow. During this time, she also won the Life Sciences Track and the Audience Choice Award in the 2010 MIT $100K Entrepreneurship competition as a member of Aukera Therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After HBS, Polli launched pymetrics, which harnessed advancements in cognitive science and machine learning to develop analytics-driven decision-making and performance enhancement software for the human capital sector. She holds multiple patents for the technology developed at pymetrics, which she co-founded in 2012 and led as CEO until her successful exit in 2022.&amp;nbsp;Pymetrics was a World Economic Forum’s Technology Pioneer and Global Innovator, an Inc. 5000’s Fastest-Growing company, and Forbes Artificial Intelligence 50 company.&amp;nbsp;Polli and pymetrics also played a pivotal role in passing the first-in-the-nation algorithmic bias law — New York’s Automated Employment Decision Tool law — which went into effect in July 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making her return to MIT as a visiting innovation scholar, Polli is collaborating closely with Sendhil Mullainathan, the Peter de Florez Professor in the departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Economics, and a principal investigator in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems. With Mullainathan, she is working to bring together a broad array of faculty, students, and postdocs across MIT to address concrete problems where &lt;a href="https://tot.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;humans and algorithms intersect&lt;/a&gt;, to develop a new subdomain of computer science specific to behavioral science, and to train the next generation of scientists to be bilingual in these two fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes you get lucky, and sometimes you get unreasonably lucky. Frida has thrived in each of the facets we’re looking to have impact in — academia, civil society, and the marketplace. She combines a startup mentality with an abiding interest in positive social impact, while capable of ensuring the kind of intellectual rigor MIT demands. It’s an exceptionally rare combination, one we are unreasonably lucky to have,” says Mullainathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People are increasingly interacting with algorithms, often with poor results, because most algorithms are not built with human interplay in mind,” says Polli. “We will focus on designing algorithms that will work synergistically with people. Only such algorithms can help us address large societal challenges in education, health care, poverty, et cetera.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polli was recognized as one of &lt;em&gt;Inc.'s&lt;/em&gt; Top 100 Female Founders in 2019, followed by being named to &lt;em&gt;Entrepreneur's&lt;/em&gt; Top 100 Powerful Women in 2020, and to the 2024 list of 100 Brilliant Women in AI Ethics. Her work has been highlighted by major outlets including &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Inc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond her role at pymetrics, she founded Alethia AI in 2023, an organization focused on promoting transparency in technology, and in 2024, she launched Rosalind Ventures, dedicated to investing in women founders in science and health care. She is also an advisor at the Buck Institute’s Center for Healthy Aging in Women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm delighted to welcome Dr. Polli back to MIT. As a bilingual expert in both behavioral science and AI, she is a natural fit for the college. Her entrepreneurial background makes her a terrific inaugural visiting innovation scholar,” says Dan Huttenlocher, dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and the Henry Ellis Warren Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Need a research hypothesis? Ask AI.</title>

  <description><![CDATA[MIT engineers developed AI frameworks to identify evidence-driven hypotheses that could advance biologically inspired materials.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Crafting a unique and promising research hypothesis is a fundamental skill for any scientist. It can also be time consuming: New PhD candidates might spend the first year of their program trying to decide exactly what to explore in their experiments. What if artificial intelligence could help?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT researchers have created a way to autonomously generate and evaluate promising research hypotheses across fields, through human-AI collaboration. In a new paper, they describe how they used this framework to create evidence-driven hypotheses that align with unmet research needs in the field of biologically inspired materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202413523" target="_blank"&gt;Published Wednesday in &lt;em&gt;Advanced Materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the study was co-authored by Alireza Ghafarollahi, a postdoc in the Laboratory for Atomistic and Molecular Mechanics (LAMM), and Markus Buehler, the Jerry McAfee Professor in Engineering in MIT’s departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering and of Mechanical Engineering and director of LAMM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The framework, which the researchers call SciAgents, consists of multiple AI agents, each with specific capabilities and access to data, that leverage “graph reasoning” methods, where AI models utilize a knowledge graph that organizes and defines relationships between diverse scientific concepts. The multi-agent approach mimics the way biological systems organize themselves as groups of elementary building blocks. Buehler notes that this “divide and conquer” principle is a prominent paradigm in biology at many levels, from materials to swarms of insects to civilizations — all examples where the total intelligence is much greater than the sum of individuals’ abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By using multiple AI agents, we’re trying to simulate the process by which communities of scientists make discoveries,” says Buehler. “At MIT, we do that by having a bunch of people with different backgrounds working together and bumping into each other at coffee shops or in MIT’s Infinite Corridor. But that's very coincidental and slow. Our quest is to simulate the process of discovery by exploring whether AI systems can be creative and make discoveries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automating good ideas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As recent developments have demonstrated, large language models (LLMs) have shown an impressive ability to answer questions, summarize information, and execute simple tasks. But they are quite limited when it comes to generating new ideas from scratch. The MIT researchers wanted to design a system that enabled AI models to perform a more sophisticated, multistep process that goes beyond recalling information learned during training, to extrapolate and create new knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foundation of their approach is an ontological knowledge graph, which organizes and makes connections between diverse scientific concepts. To make the graphs, the researchers feed a set of scientific papers into a generative AI model. In &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/graph-based-ai-model-maps-future-innovation-1112" target="_blank"&gt;previous work&lt;/a&gt;, Buehler used a field of math known as category theory to help the AI model develop abstractions of scientific concepts as graphs, rooted in defining relationships between components, in a way that could be analyzed by other models through a process called graph reasoning. This focuses AI models on developing a more principled way to understand concepts; it also allows them to generalize better across domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is really important for us to create science-focused AI models, as scientific theories are typically rooted in generalizable principles rather than just knowledge recall,” Buehler says. “By focusing AI models on ‘thinking’ in such a manner, we can leapfrog beyond conventional methods and explore more creative uses of AI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the most recent paper, the researchers used about 1,000 scientific studies on biological materials, but Buehler says the knowledge graphs could be generated using far more or fewer research papers from any field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the graph established, the researchers developed an AI system for scientific discovery, with multiple models specialized to play specific roles in the system. Most of the components were built off of OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4 series models and made use of a technique known as in-context learning, in which prompts provide contextual information about the model’s role in the system while allowing it to learn from data provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The individual agents in the framework interact with each other to collectively solve a complex problem that none of them would be able to do alone. The first task they are given is to generate the research hypothesis. The LLM interactions start after a subgraph has been defined from the knowledge graph, which can happen randomly or by manually entering a pair of keywords discussed in the papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the framework, a language model the researchers named the “Ontologist” is tasked with defining scientific terms in the papers and examining the connections between them, fleshing out the knowledge graph. A model named “Scientist 1” then crafts a research proposal based on factors like its ability to uncover unexpected properties and novelty. The proposal includes a discussion of potential findings, the impact of the research, and a guess at the underlying mechanisms of action. A “Scientist 2” model expands on the idea, suggesting specific experimental and simulation approaches and making other improvements. Finally, a “Critic” model highlights its strengths and weaknesses and suggests further improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s about building a team of experts that are not all thinking the same way,” Buehler says. “They have to think differently and have different capabilities. The Critic agent is deliberately programmed to critique the others, so you don't have everybody agreeing and saying it’s a great idea. You have an agent saying, ‘There’s a weakness here, can you explain it better?’ That makes the output much different from single models.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other agents in the system are able to search existing literature, which provides the system with a way to not only assess feasibility but also create and assess the novelty of each idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making the system stronger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To validate their approach, Buehler and Ghafarollahi built a knowledge graph based on the words “silk” and “energy intensive.” Using the framework, the “Scientist 1” model proposed integrating silk with dandelion-based pigments to create biomaterials with enhanced optical and mechanical properties. The model predicted the material would be significantly stronger than traditional silk materials and require less energy to process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientist 2 then made suggestions, such as using specific molecular dynamic simulation tools to explore how the proposed materials would interact, adding that a good application for the material would be a bioinspired adhesive. The Critic model then highlighted several strengths of the proposed material and areas for improvement, such as its scalability, long-term stability, and the environmental impacts of solvent use. To address those concerns, the Critic suggested conducting pilot studies for process validation and performing rigorous analyses of material durability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also conducted other experiments with randomly chosen keywords, which produced various original hypotheses about more efficient biomimetic microfluidic chips, enhancing the mechanical properties of collagen-based scaffolds, and the interaction between graphene and amyloid fibrils to create bioelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The system was able to come up with these new, rigorous ideas based on the path from the knowledge graph,” Ghafarollahi says. “In terms of novelty and applicability, the materials seemed robust and novel. In future work, we’re going to generate thousands, or tens of thousands, of new research ideas, and then we can categorize them, try to understand better how these materials are generated and how they could be improved further.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the researchers hope to incorporate new tools for retrieving information and running simulations into their frameworks. They can also easily swap out the foundation models in their frameworks for more advanced models, allowing the system to adapt with the latest innovations in AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because of the way these agents interact, an improvement in one model, even if it’s slight, has a huge impact on the overall behaviors and output of the system,” Buehler says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since releasing a preprint with open-source details of their approach, the researchers have been contacted by hundreds of people interested in using the frameworks in diverse scientific fields and even areas like finance and cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of stuff you can do without having to go to the lab,” Buehler says. “You want to basically go to the lab at the very end of the process. The lab is expensive and takes a long time, so you want a system that can drill very deep into the best ideas, formulating the best hypotheses and accurately predicting emergent behaviors. Our vision is to make this easy to use, so you can use an app to bring in other ideas or drag in datasets to really challenge the model to make new discoveries.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On June 18, 2023, the Titan submersible was about an hour-and-a-half into its two-hour descent to the Titanic wreckage at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean when it lost contact with its support ship. This cease in communication set off a frantic search for the tourist submersible and five passengers onboard, located about two miles below the ocean's surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep-ocean search and recovery is one of the many missions of military services like the U.S. Coast Guard Office of Search and Rescue and the U.S. Navy Supervisor of Salvage and Diving. For this mission, the longest delays come from transporting search-and-rescue equipment via ship to the area of interest and comprehensively surveying that area. A search operation on the scale of that for Titan — which was conducted 420 nautical miles from the nearest port and covered 13,000 square kilometers, an area roughly twice the size of Connecticut — could take weeks to complete. The search area for Titan is considered relatively small, focused on the immediate vicinity of the Titanic. When the area is less known, operations could take months. (A remotely operated underwater vehicle deployed by a Canadian vessel ended up finding the debris field of Titan on the seafloor, four days after the submersible had gone missing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team from MIT Lincoln Laboratory and the &lt;a href="https://meche.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="https://meche.mit.edu/research/ocean"&gt;Ocean Science and Engineering&lt;/a&gt; lab is developing a surface-based sonar system that could accelerate the timeline for small- and large-scale search operations to days. Called the Autonomous Sparse-Aperture Multibeam Echo Sounder, the system scans at surface-ship rates while providing sufficient resolution to find objects and features in the deep ocean, without the time and expense of deploying underwater vehicles. The echo sounder — which features a large sonar array using a small set of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) that can be deployed via aircraft into the ocean — holds the potential to map the seabed at 50 times the coverage rate of an underwater vehicle and 100 times the resolution of a surface vessel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our array provides the best of both worlds: the high resolution of underwater vehicles and the high coverage rate of surface ships," says co–principal investigator Andrew March, assistant leader of the laboratory's &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/air-missile-and-maritime-defense-technology/advanced-undersea-systems-and-technology"&gt;Advanced Undersea Systems and Technology Group&lt;/a&gt;. "Though large surface-based sonar systems at low frequency have the potential to determine the materials and profiles of the seabed, they typically do so at the expense of resolution, particularly with increasing ocean depth. Our array can likely determine this information, too, but at significantly enhanced resolution in the deep ocean."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underwater unknown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oceans cover 71 percent of Earth's surface, yet more than 80 percent of this underwater realm remains undiscovered and unexplored. Humans know more about the surface of other planets and the moon than the bottom of our oceans. High-resolution seabed maps would not only be useful to find missing objects like ships or aircraft, but also to support a host of other scientific applications: understanding Earth's geology, improving forecasting of ocean currents and corresponding weather and climate impacts, uncovering archaeological sites, monitoring marine ecosystems and habitats, and identifying locations containing natural resources such as mineral and oil deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists and governments worldwide recognize the importance of creating a high-resolution global map of the seafloor; the problem is that no existing technology can achieve meter-scale resolution from the ocean surface. The average depth of our oceans is approximately 3,700 meters. However, today's technologies capable of finding human-made objects on the seabed or identifying person-sized natural features — these technologies include sonar, lidar, cameras, and gravitational field mapping — have a maximum range of less than 1,000 meters through water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ships with large sonar arrays mounted on their hull map the deep ocean by emitting low-frequency sound waves that bounce off the seafloor and return as echoes to the surface. Operation at low frequencies is necessary because water readily absorbs high-frequency sound waves, especially with increasing depth; however, such operation yields low-resolution images, with each image pixel representing a football field in size. Resolution is also restricted because sonar arrays installed on large mapping ships are already using all of the available hull space, thereby capping the sonar beam's aperture size. By contrast, sonars on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that operate at higher frequencies within a few hundred meters of the seafloor generate maps with each pixel representing one square meter or less, resulting in 10,000 times more pixels in that same football field–sized area. However, this higher resolution comes with trade-offs: AUVs are time-consuming and expensive to deploy in the deep ocean, limiting the amount of seafloor that can be mapped; they have a maximum range of about 1,000 meters before their high-frequency sound gets absorbed; and they move at slow speeds to conserve power. The area-coverage rate of AUVs performing high-resolution mapping is about 8 square kilometers per hour; surface vessels map the deep ocean at more than 50 times that rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A solution surfaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Autonomous Sparse-Aperture Multibeam Echo Sounder could offer a cost-effective approach to high-resolution, rapid mapping of the deep seafloor from the ocean's surface. A collaborative fleet of about 20 ASVs, each hosting a small sonar array, effectively forms a single sonar array 100 times the size of a large sonar array installed on a ship. The large aperture achieved by the array (hundreds of meters) produces a narrow beam, which enables sound to be precisely steered to generate high-resolution maps at low frequency. Because very few sonars are installed relative to the array's overall size (i.e., a sparse aperture), the cost is tractable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this collaborative and sparse setup introduces some operational challenges. First, for coherent 3D imaging, the relative position of each ASV's sonar subarray must be accurately tracked through dynamic ocean-induced motions. Second, because sonar elements are not placed directly next to each other without any gaps, the array suffers from a lower signal-to-noise ratio and is less able to reject noise coming from unintended or undesired directions. To mitigate these challenges, the team has been developing a low-cost precision-relative navigation system and leveraging acoustic signal processing tools and new ocean-field estimation algorithms. The MIT campus collaborators are developing algorithms for data processing and image formation, especially to estimate depth-integrated water-column parameters. These enabling technologies will help account for complex ocean physics, spanning physical properties like temperature, dynamic processes like currents and waves, and acoustic propagation factors like sound speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processing for all required control and calculations could be completed either remotely or onboard the ASVs. For example, ASVs deployed from a ship or flying boat could be controlled and guided remotely from land via a satellite link or from a nearby support ship (with direct communications or a satellite link), and left to map the seabed for weeks or months at a time until maintenance is needed. Sonar-return health checks and coarse seabed mapping would be conducted on board, while full, high-resolution reconstruction of the seabed would require a supercomputing infrastructure on land or on a support ship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Deploying vehicles in an area and letting them map for extended periods of time without the need for a ship to return home to replenish supplies and rotate crews would significantly simplify logistics and operating costs," says co–principal investigator Paul Ryu, a researcher in the Advanced Undersea Systems and Technology Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since beginning their research in 2018, the team has turned their concept into a prototype. Initially, the scientists built a scale model of a sparse-aperture sonar array and tested it in a water tank at the laboratory's &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/about/facilities/autonomous-systems-development-facility"&gt;Autonomous Systems Development Facility&lt;/a&gt;. Then, they prototyped an ASV-sized sonar subarray and demonstrated its functionality in Gloucester, Massachusetts. In follow-on sea tests in Boston Harbor, they deployed an 8-meter array containing multiple subarrays equivalent to 25 ASVs locked together; with this array, they generated 3D reconstructions of the seafloor and a shipwreck. Most recently, the team fabricated, in collaboration with &lt;a href="https://www.whoi.edu/"&gt;Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution&lt;/a&gt;, a first-generation, 12-foot-long, all-electric ASV prototype carrying a sonar array underneath. With this prototype, they conducted preliminary relative navigation testing in Woods Hole, Massachusetts and Newport, Rhode Island. Their full deep-ocean concept calls for approximately 20 such ASVs of a similar size, likely powered by wave or solar energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was funded through Lincoln Laboratory's internally administered R&amp;amp;D portfolio on &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/technology-office/emerging-technology"&gt;autonomous systems&lt;/a&gt;. The team is now seeking external sponsorship to continue development of their ocean floor–mapping technology, which was recognized with a 2024 R&amp;amp;D 100 Award.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With the cover of anonymity and the company of strangers, the appeal of the digital world is growing as a place to seek out mental health support. This phenomenon is buoyed by the fact that&lt;a href="https://www.aamc.org/news/growing-psychiatrist-shortage-enormous-demand-mental-health-services"&gt;&amp;nbsp;over 150 million people&lt;/a&gt; in the United States live in federally designated mental health professional shortage areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I really need your help, as I am too scared to talk to a therapist and I can’t reach one anyways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Am I overreacting, getting hurt about husband making fun of me to his friends?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Could some strangers please weigh in on my life and decide my future for me?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The above quotes are real posts taken from users on Reddit, a social media news website and forum where users can share content or ask for advice in smaller, interest-based forums known as “subreddits.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Using a dataset of 12,513 posts with 70,429 responses from 26 mental health-related subreddits, researchers from MIT, New York University (NYU), and University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) devised&lt;a href="https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.120.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.120.pdf"&gt;a framework&lt;/a&gt; to help evaluate the equity and overall quality of mental health support chatbots based on large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. Their work was recently published at the 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To accomplish this, researchers asked two licensed clinical psychologists to evaluate 50 randomly sampled Reddit posts seeking mental health support, pairing each post with either a Redditor’s real response or a GPT-4 generated response. Without knowing which responses were real or which were AI-generated, the psychologists were asked to assess the level of empathy in each response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mental health support chatbots have long been explored as a way of improving access to mental health support, but powerful LLMs like OpenAI’s ChatGPT are transforming human-AI interaction, with AI-generated responses becoming harder to distinguish from the responses of real humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Despite this remarkable progress, the unintended consequences of AI-provided mental health support have drawn attention to its potentially deadly risks; in March of last year, a Belgian man died by suicide as a result of an exchange with ELIZA, a chatbot developed to emulate a psychotherapist powered with an LLM called GPT-J. One month later, the National Eating Disorders Association would suspend their chatbot Tessa, after the chatbot began dispensing dieting tips to patients with eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Saadia Gabriel, a recent MIT postdoc who is now a UCLA assistant professor and first author of the paper, admitted that she was initially very skeptical of how effective mental health support chatbots could actually be. Gabriel conducted this research during her time as a postdoc at MIT in the Healthy Machine Learning Group, led Marzyeh Ghassemi, an MIT associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and MIT Institute for Medical Engineering and Science who is affiliated with the MIT Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What Gabriel and the team of researchers found was that GPT-4 responses were not only more empathetic overall, but they were 48 percent better at encouraging positive behavioral changes than human responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;However, in a bias evaluation, the researchers found that GPT-4’s response empathy levels were reduced for Black (2 to 15 percent lower) and Asian posters (5 to 17 percent lower) compared to white posters or posters whose race was unknown.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To evaluate bias in GPT-4 responses and human responses, researchers included different kinds of posts with explicit demographic (e.g., gender, race) leaks and implicit demographic leaks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;An explicit demographic leak would look like: “I am a 32yo Black woman.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Whereas an implicit demographic leak would look like: “Being a 32yo girl wearing my natural hair,” in which keywords are used to indicate certain demographics to GPT-4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With the exception of Black female posters, GPT-4’s responses were found to be less affected by explicit and implicit demographic leaking compared to human responders, who tended to be more empathetic when responding to posts with implicit demographic suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The structure of the input you give [the LLM] and some information about the context, like whether you want [the LLM] to act in the style of a clinician, the style of a social media post, or whether you want it to use demographic attributes of the patient, has a major impact on the response you get back,” Gabriel says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The paper suggests that explicitly providing instruction for LLMs to use demographic attributes can effectively alleviate bias, as this was the only method where researchers did not observe a significant difference in empathy across the different demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Gabriel hopes this work can help ensure more comprehensive and thoughtful evaluation of LLMs being deployed in clinical settings across demographic subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“LLMs are already being used to provide patient-facing support and have been deployed in medical settings, in many cases to automate inefficient human systems,” Ghassemi says. “Here, we demonstrated that while state-of-the-art LLMs are generally less affected by demographic leaking than humans in peer-to-peer mental health support, they do not provide equitable mental health responses across inferred patient subgroups ... we have a lot of opportunity to improve models so they provide improved support when used.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="3" paraeid="{6b133ffa-7ff4-4510-93ca-b095c3392f0d}{212}"&gt;Throughout 2024, MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research has celebrated 50 years of MIT’s cancer research program and the individuals who have shaped its journey. In honor of this milestone anniversary year, on Nov. 19 the Koch Institute celebrated the opening of a new exhibition: Object Lessons: Celebrating 50 Years of Cancer Research at MIT in 10 Items.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p paraid="3" paraeid="{6b133ffa-7ff4-4510-93ca-b095c3392f0d}{212}"&gt;Object Lessons invites the public to explore significant artifacts — from one of the earliest PCR machines, developed in the lab of Nobel laureate H. Robert Horvitz, to Greta, a groundbreaking zebra fish from the lab of Professor Nancy Hopkins — in the half-century of discoveries and advancements that have positioned MIT at the forefront of the fight against cancer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="2" paraid="4" paraeid="{6b133ffa-7ff4-4510-93ca-b095c3392f0d}{244}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50 years of innovation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="6" paraeid="{6b133ffa-7ff4-4510-93ca-b095c3392f0d}{250}"&gt;The exhibition provides a glimpse into the many contributors and advancements that have defined MIT’s cancer research history since the founding of the Center for Cancer Research in 1974. When the National Cancer Act was passed in 1971, very little was understood about the biology of cancer, and it aimed to deepen our understanding of cancer and develop better strategies for the prevention, detection, and treatment of the disease. MIT embraced this call to action, establishing a center where many leading biologists tackled cancer’s fundamental questions. Building on this foundation, the Koch Institute opened its doors in 2011, housing engineers and life scientists from many fields under one roof to accelerate progress against cancer in novel and transformative ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="7" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{49}"&gt;In the 13 years since, the Koch Institute’s collaborative and interdisciplinary approach to cancer research has yielded significant advances in our understanding of the underlying biology of cancer and allowed for the translation of these discoveries into meaningful patient impacts. Over 120 spin-out companies — many headquartered nearby in the Kendall Square area — have their roots in Koch Institute research, with nearly half having advanced their technologies to clinical trials or commercial applications. The Koch Institute’s collaborative approach extends beyond its labs: principal investigators often form partnerships with colleagues at world-renowned medical centers, bridging the gap between discovery and clinical impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="801031442" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{59}"&gt;Current Koch Institute Director Matthew Vander Heiden, also a practicing oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, is driven by patient stories.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="8" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{65}"&gt;“It is never lost on us that the work we do in the lab is important to change the reality of cancer for patients,” he says. “We are constantly motivated by the urgent need to translate our research and improve outcomes for those impacted by cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" paraid="9" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{75}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symbols of progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="10" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{81}"&gt;The items on display as part of Object Lessons take viewers on a journey through five decades of MIT cancer research, from the pioneering days of Salvador Luria, founding director of the Center for Cancer Research, to some of the Koch Institute’s newest investigators, including Francisco Sánchez-Rivera, the Eisen and Chang Career Development Professor and an assistant professor of biology, and Jessica Stark, the Underwood-Prescott Career Development Professor and an assistant professor of biological engineering and chemical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="11" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{103}"&gt;Among the standout pieces is a humble yet iconic object: Salvador Luria’s ceramic mug, emblazoned with “Luria’s broth.” Lysogeny broth, often called — apocryphally — Luria Broth, is a medium for growing bacteria. Still in use today, the recipe was first published in 1951 by a research associate in Luria’s lab. The artifact, on loan from the MIT Museum, symbolizes the foundational years of the Center for Cancer Research and serves as a reminder of Luria’s influence as an early visionary. His work set the stage for a new era of biological inquiry that would shape cancer research at MIT for generations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="12" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{147}"&gt;Visitors can explore firsthand how the Koch Institute continues to build on the legacy of its predecessors, translating decades of knowledge into new tools and therapies that have the potential to transform patient care and cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1754580287" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{153}"&gt;For instance, the PCR machine designed in the Horvitz Lab in the 1980s made genetic manipulation of cells easier, and gene sequencing faster and more cost-effective. At the time of its commercialization, this groundbreaking benchtop unit marked a major leap forward. In the decades since, technological advances have allowed for the visualization of DNA and biological processes at a much smaller scale, as demonstrated by the handheld BioBits imaging device developed by Stark and on display next door to the Horvitz panel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p xml:lang="EN-US" paraid="2026162156" paraeid="{3cd7ccfb-26ff-41d9-91eb-99186b733e57}{205}" lang="EN-US"&gt;“We created BioBits kits to address a need for increased equity in STEM education,” Stark says. “By making hands-on biology education approachable and affordable, BioBits kits are helping inspire and empower the next generation of scientists."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="595247363" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{201}"&gt;While the exhibition showcases scientific discoveries and marvels of engineering, it also aims to underscore the human element of cancer research through personally significant items, such as a messenger bag and Seq-Well device belonging to Alex Shalek, J. W. Kieckhefer Professor in the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Department of Chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="15" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{223}"&gt;Shalek&amp;nbsp;investigates the molecular differences between individual cells, developing mobile RNA-sequencing devices. He could often be seen toting the bag around the Boston area and worldwide as he perfected and shared his technology with collaborators near and far. Through his work, Shalek has helped to make single-cell sequencing accessible for labs in more than 30 countries across six continents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="16" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{251}"&gt;“The KI seamlessly brings together students, staff, clinicians, and faculty across multiple different disciplines to collaboratively derive transformative insights into cancer,” Shalek says. “To me, these sorts of partnerships are the best part about being at MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="17" paraeid="{324e93ce-641e-465b-8e7b-790273263246}{2}"&gt;Around the corner from Shalek’s display, visitors will find an object that serves as a stark reminder of the real people impacted by Koch Institute research: Steven Keating’s SM ’12, PhD ’16 3D-printed model of his own brain tumor. Keating, who passed away in 2019, became a fierce advocate for the rights of patients to their medical data, and came to know Vander Heiden through his pursuit to become an expert on his tumor type, IDH-mutant glioma. In the years since, Vander Heiden’s work has contributed to a new therapy to treat Keating’s tumor type. In 2024, the drug, called vorasidenib, gained FDA approval, providing the first therapeutic breakthrough for Keating’s cancer in more than 20 years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="18" paraeid="{324e93ce-641e-465b-8e7b-790273263246}{36}"&gt;As the Koch Institute looks to the future, Object Lessons stands as a celebration of the people, the science, and the culture that have defined MIT’s first half-century of breakthroughs and contributions to the field of cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="19" paraeid="{324e93ce-641e-465b-8e7b-790273263246}{42}"&gt;“Working in the uniquely collaborative environment of the Koch Institute and MIT, I am confident that we will continue to unlock key insights in the fight against cancer,” says Vander Heiden. “Our community is poised to embark on our next 50 years with the same passion and innovation that has carried us this far.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="582443480" paraeid="{324e93ce-641e-465b-8e7b-790273263246}{52}"&gt;Object Lessons is on view in the Koch Institute Public Galleries Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., through spring semester 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Danna Lorch | MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brought together as part of the &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/"&gt;Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing&lt;/a&gt; (SERC) initiative within the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, a community of students known as &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/serc-scholars-program/"&gt;SERC Scholars&lt;/a&gt; is collaborating to examine the most urgent problems humans face in the digital landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each semester, students from all levels from across MIT are invited to join a different topical working group led by a SERC postdoctoral associate. Each group delves into a specific issue — such as surveillance or data ownership — culminating in a final project presented at the end of the term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, students complete the program with hands-on experience conducting research in a new cross-disciplinary field. However, one group of undergraduate and graduate students recently had the unique opportunity to enhance their resume by becoming published authors of a case study about the environmental and climate justice implications of the electronics hardware life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it’s not uncommon for graduate students to co-author case studies, it’s unusual for undergraduates to earn this opportunity — and for their audience to be other undergraduates around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our team was insanely interdisciplinary,” says Anastasia Dunca, a junior studying computer science and one of the co-authors. “I joined the SERC Scholars Program&amp;nbsp;because I liked the idea of being part of a cohort from across MIT working on a project that utilized all of our skillsets. It also helps [undergraduates] learn the ins and outs of computing ethics research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case study co-author Jasmin Liu, an MBA student in the MIT Sloan School of Management,&amp;nbsp;sees&amp;nbsp;the program as a platform to learn about the intersection of technology, society, and ethics:&amp;nbsp;“I met team members spanning computer science, urban planning, to art/culture/technology. I was excited to work with a diverse team because I know complex problems must be approached with many different perspectives. Combining my background in humanities and business with the expertise of others allowed us to be more innovative and comprehensive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Rabe, a former SERC postdoc who facilitated the group, says, “I let the students take the lead on identifying the topic and conducting the research.” His goal for the group was to challenge students across disciplines to develop a working definition of climate justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From mining to e-waste&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SERC Scholars’ case study, “&lt;a href="https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/w9ht6hue/release/5"&gt;From Mining to E-waste: The Environmental and Climate Justice Implications of the Electronics Hardware Life Cycle&lt;/a&gt;,” was published by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/"&gt;MIT Case Studies in Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing case studies series, which releases new issues twice a year on an open-source platform, is enabling undergraduate instructors worldwide to incorporate research-based education materials on computing ethics into their existing class syllabi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular case study broke down the electronics life cycle from mining to manufacturing, usage, and disposal. It offered an in-depth look at how this cycle promotes inequity in the Global South. Mining for the average of 60 minerals that power everyday devices lead to illegal deforestation, compromising air quality in the Amazon, and triggering armed conflict in Congo. Manufacturing leads to proven health risks for both formal and informal workers, some of whom are child laborers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life cycle assessment and circular economy are proposed as mechanisms for analyzing environmental and climate justice issues in the electronics life cycle. Rather than posing solutions, the case study offers readers entry points for further discussion and for assessing their own individual responsibility as producers of e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crufting and crafting a case study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunca joined Rabe's working group, intrigued by the invitation to conduct a rigorous literature review examining issues like data center resource and energy use, manufacturing waste, ethical issues with AI, and climate change. Rabe quickly realized that a common thread among all participants was an interest in understanding and reducing e-waste and its impact on the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I came in with the idea of us co-authoring a case study,” Rabe said. However, the writing-intensive process was initially daunting to those students who were used to conducting applied research. Once Rabe created sub-groups with discrete tasks, the steps for researching, writing, and iterating a case study became more approachable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Ellie Bultena, an undergraduate student studying linguistics and philosophy and a contributor to the study, that meant conducting field research on the loading dock of MIT’s Stata Center, where students and faculty go “crufting” through piles of clunky printers, broken computers, and used lab equipment discarded by the Institute's labs, departments, and individual users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although not a formally sanctioned activity on-campus, “crufting” is the act of gleaning usable parts from these junk piles to be repurposed into new equipment or art. Bultena’s respondents, who opted to be anonymous, said that MIT could do better when it comes to the amount of e-waste generated and suggested that formal strategies could be implemented to encourage community members to repair equipment more easily or recycle more formally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabe, now an education program director at the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative, is hopeful that through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://sustainability.mit.edu/topic/zero-carbon-campus"&gt;Zero-Carbon Campus Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, which commits MIT to eliminating all direct emissions by 2050, MIT will ultimately become a model for other higher education institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the group lacked the time and resources to travel to communities in the Global South that they profiled in their case study, members leaned into exhaustive secondary research, collecting data on how some countries are irresponsibly dumping e-waste. In contrast, others have developed alternative solutions that can be duplicated elsewhere and scaled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We source materials, manufacture them, and then throw them away,” Lelia Hampton says. A PhD candidate in electrical engineering and computer science and another co-author,&amp;nbsp;Hampton jumped at the opportunity to serve in a writing role, bringing together the sub-groups research findings. “I’d never written a case study, and it was exciting. Now I want to write 10 more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content directly informed Hampton’s dissertation research, which “looks at applying machine learning to climate justice issues such as urban heat islands.” She said that writing a case study that is accessible to general audiences upskilled her for the non-profit organization she’s determined to start. “It’s going to provide communities with free resources and data needed to understand how they are impacted by climate change and begin to advocate against injustice,” Hampton explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunca, Liu, Rabe, Bultena, and Hampton are joined on the case study by fellow authors Mrinalini Singha, a graduate student in the Art, Culture, and Technology program; Sungmoon Lim, a graduate student in urban studies and planning and EECS; Lauren Higgins, an undergraduate majoring in political science; and Madeline Schlegel, a Northeastern University co-op student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking the case study to classrooms around the world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although PhD candidates have contributed to previous case studies in the series, this publication is the first to be co-authored with MIT undergraduates. Like any other peer-reviewed journal, before publication, the SERC Scholars’ case study was anonymously reviewed by senior scholars drawn from various fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The series editor, David Kaiser, also served as one of SERC’s inaugural associate deans and helped shape the program. “The case studies, by design, are short, easy to read, and don't take up lots of time,” Kaiser explained. “They are gateways for students to explore, and instructors can cover a topic that has likely already been on their mind.” This semester, Kaiser, the Germeshausen Professor of the History of Science and a professor of physics, is teaching STS.004 (Intersections: Science, Technology, and the World), an undergraduate introduction to the field of science, technology, and society. The last month of the semester has been dedicated wholly to SERC case studies, one of which is:&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;“From Mining to E-Waste.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hampton was visibly moved to hear that the case study is being used at MIT but also by some of the 250,000 visitors to the SERC platform, many of whom are based in the Global South and directly impacted by the issues she and her cohort researched. “Many students are focused on climate, whether through computer science, data science, or mechanical engineering. I hope that this case study educates them on environmental and climate aspects of e-waste and computing.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Study: Some language reward models exhibit political bias</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) that drive generative artificial intelligence apps, such as ChatGPT, have been proliferating at lightning speed and have improved to the point that it is often impossible to distinguish between something written through generative AI and human-composed text. However, these models can also sometimes generate false statements or display a political bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, in recent years, a number of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91165664/ai-models-lean-left-when-it-comes-to-politically-charged-questions" title="https://www.fastcompany.com/91165664/ai-models-lean-left-when-it-comes-to-politically-charged-questions"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4316084" title="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4316084"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that LLM systems have a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-023-01097-2"&gt;tendency to display a left-leaning political bias&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study conducted by researchers at MIT’s Center for Constructive Communication (CCC) provides support for the notion that reward models — models trained on human preference data that evaluate how well an LLM's response aligns with human preferences — may also be biased, even when trained on statements known to be objectively truthful. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to train reward models to be both truthful and politically unbiased?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the question that the CCC team, led by PhD candidate Suyash Fulay and Research Scientist Jad Kabbara, sought to answer. In a series of experiments, Fulay, Kabbara, and their CCC colleagues found that training models to differentiate truth from falsehood did not eliminate political bias. In fact, they found that optimizing reward models consistently showed a left-leaning political bias. And that this bias becomes greater in larger models. “We were actually quite surprised to see this persist even after training them only on ‘truthful’ datasets, which are supposedly objective,” says Kabbara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoon Kim, the NBX Career Development Professor in MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, who was not involved in the work, elaborates, “One consequence of using monolithic architectures for language models is that they learn entangled representations that&amp;nbsp;are difficult to interpret and disentangle. This may result in phenomena&amp;nbsp;such as one highlighted in this study, where a language model trained for a particular downstream task surfaces unexpected and unintended biases.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A paper describing the work, “&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2409.05283"&gt;On the Relationship Between Truth and Political Bias in Language Models&lt;/a&gt;,” was presented by Fulay at the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing on Nov. 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Left-leaning bias, even for models trained to be maximally truthful&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For this work, the researchers used reward models trained on two types of “alignment data” — high-quality data that are used to further train the models after their initial training on vast amounts of internet data and other large-scale datasets. The first were reward models trained on subjective human preferences, which is the standard approach to aligning LLMs. The second, “truthful” or “objective data” reward models, were trained on scientific facts, common sense, or facts about entities. Reward models are versions of pretrained language models that are primarily used to “align” LLMs to human preferences, making them safer and less toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we train reward models, the model gives each statement a score, with higher scores indicating a better response and vice-versa,” says Fulay. “We were particularly interested in the scores these reward models gave to political statements.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their first experiment, the researchers found that several open-source reward models trained on subjective human preferences showed a consistent left-leaning bias, giving higher scores to left-leaning than right-leaning statements. To ensure the accuracy of the left- or right-leaning stance for the statements generated by the LLM, the authors manually checked a subset of statements and also used a political stance detector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examples of statements considered left-leaning include: “The government should heavily subsidize health care.” and “Paid family leave should be mandated by law to support working parents.” Examples of statements considered right-leaning include: “Private markets are still the best way to ensure affordable health care.” and “Paid family leave should be voluntary and determined by employers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers then considered what would happen if they trained the reward model only on statements considered more objectively factual. An example of an objectively “true” statement is: “The British museum is located in London, United Kingdom.” An example of an objectively “false” statement is “The Danube River is the longest river in Africa.” These objective statements contained little-to-no political content, and thus the researchers hypothesized that these objective reward models should exhibit no political bias. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But they did. In fact, the researchers found that training reward models on objective truths and falsehoods still led the models to have a consistent left-leaning political bias. The bias was consistent when the model training used datasets representing various types of truth and appeared to get larger as the model scaled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They found that the left-leaning political bias was especially strong on topics like climate, energy, or labor unions, and weakest — or even reversed — for the topics of taxes and the death penalty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Obviously, as LLMs become more widely deployed, we need to develop an understanding of why we’re seeing these biases so we can find ways to remedy this,” says Kabbara.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truth vs. objectivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These results suggest a potential tension in achieving both truthful and unbiased models, making identifying the source of this bias a promising direction for future research. Key to this future work will be an understanding of whether optimizing for truth will lead to more or less political bias. If, for example, fine-tuning a model on objective realities still increases political bias, would this require having to sacrifice truthfulness for unbiased-ness, or vice-versa?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“These are questions that appear to be salient for both the ‘real world’ and LLMs,” says Deb Roy, professor of media sciences, CCC director, and one of the paper’s coauthors. “Searching for answers related to political bias in a timely fashion is especially important in our current polarized environment, where scientific facts are too often doubted and false narratives abound.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Center for Constructive Communication is an Institute-wide center based at the Media Lab. In addition to Fulay, Kabbara, and Roy, co-authors on the work include media arts and sciences graduate students William Brannon, Shrestha Mohanty, Cassandra Overney, and Elinor Poole-Dayan.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For all the talk about artificial intelligence upending the world, its economic effects remain uncertain. There is massive investment in AI but little clarity about what it will produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examining AI has become a significant part of Nobel-winning economist Daron Acemoglu’s work. An Institute Professor at MIT, Acemoglu has long studied the impact of technology in society, from modeling the large-scale adoption of innovations to conducting empirical studies about the impact of robots on jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Acemoglu also shared the 2024 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel with two collaborators, Simon Johnson PhD ’89 of the MIT Sloan School of Management and James Robinson of the University of Chicago, for research on the relationship between political institutions and economic growth. Their work shows that democracies with robust rights sustain better growth over time than other forms of government do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since a lot of growth comes from technological innovation, the way societies use AI is of keen interest to Acemoglu, who has published a variety of papers about the economics of the technology in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where will the new tasks for humans with generative AI come from?” asks Acemoglu. “I don’t think we know those yet, and that’s what the issue is. What are the apps that are really going to change how we do things?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the measurable effects of AI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1947, U.S. GDP growth has averaged about 3 percent annually, with productivity growth at about 2 percent annually. Some predictions have claimed AI will double growth or at least create a higher growth trajectory than usual. By contrast, in one paper, “&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/economicpolicy/advance-article/doi/10.1093/epolic/eiae042/7728473" target="_blank"&gt;The Simple Macroeconomics of AI&lt;/a&gt;,” published in the August issue of &lt;em&gt;Economic Policy&lt;/em&gt;, Acemoglu estimates that over the next decade, AI will produce a “modest increase” in GDP between 1.1 to 1.6 percent over the next 10 years, with a roughly 0.05 percent annual gain in productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acemoglu’s assessment is based on recent estimates about how many jobs are affected by AI, including a 2023 study by researchers at OpenAI, OpenResearch, and the University of Pennsylvania, which finds that about 20 percent of U.S. job tasks might be exposed to AI capabilities. A 2024 study by researchers from MIT FutureTech, as well as the Productivity Institute and IBM, finds that about 23 percent of computer vision tasks that can be ultimately automated could be profitably done so within the next 10 years. Still more research suggests the average cost savings from AI is about 27 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to productivity, “I don’t think we should belittle 0.5 percent in 10 years. That’s better than zero,” Acemoglu says. “But it’s just disappointing relative to the promises that people in the industry and in tech journalism are making.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, this is an estimate, and additional AI applications may emerge: As Acemoglu writes in the paper, his calculation does not include the use of AI to predict the shapes of proteins — for which other scholars subsequently shared a Nobel Prize in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other observers have suggested that “reallocations” of workers displaced by AI will create additional growth and productivity, beyond Acemoglu’s estimate, though he does not think this will matter much. “Reallocations, starting from the actual allocation that we have, typically generate only small benefits,” Acemoglu says. “The direct benefits are the big deal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds: “I tried to write the paper in a very transparent way, saying what is included and what is not included. People can disagree by saying either the things I have excluded are a big deal or the numbers for the things included are too modest, and that’s completely fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which jobs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducting such estimates can sharpen our intuitions about AI. Plenty of forecasts about AI have described it as revolutionary; other analyses are more circumspect. Acemoglu’s work helps us grasp on what scale we might expect changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let’s go out to 2030,” Acemoglu says. “How different do you think the U.S. economy is going to be because of AI? You could be a complete AI optimist and think that millions of people would have lost their jobs because of chatbots, or perhaps that some people have become super-productive workers because with AI they can do 10 times as many things as they’ve done before. I don’t think so. I think most companies are going to be doing more or less the same things. A few occupations will be impacted, but we’re still going to have journalists, we’re still going to have financial analysts, we’re still going to have HR employees.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that is right, then AI most likely applies to a bounded set of white-collar tasks, where large amounts of computational power can process a lot of inputs faster than humans can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s going to impact a bunch of office jobs that are about data summary, visual matching, pattern recognition, et cetera,” Acemoglu adds. “And those are essentially about 5 percent of the economy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Acemoglu and Johnson have sometimes been regarded as skeptics of AI, they view themselves as realists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m trying not to be bearish,” Acemoglu says. “There are things generative AI can do, and I believe that, genuinely.” However, he adds, “I believe there are ways we could use generative AI better and get bigger gains, but I don’t see them as the focus area of the industry at the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine usefulness, or worker replacement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Acemoglu says we could be using AI better, he has something specific in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of his crucial concerns about AI is whether it will take the form of “machine usefulness,” helping workers gain productivity, or whether it will be aimed at mimicking general intelligence in an effort to replace human jobs. It is the difference between, say, providing new information to a biotechnologist versus replacing a customer service worker with automated call-center technology. So far, he believes, firms have been focused on the latter type of case.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My argument is that we currently have the wrong direction for AI,” Acemoglu says. “We’re using it too much for automation and not enough for providing expertise and information to workers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acemoglu and Johnson delve into this issue in depth in their high-profile 2023 book “Power and Progress” (PublicAffairs), which has a straightforward&amp;nbsp;leading question: Technology creates economic growth, but who captures that economic growth? Is it elites, or do workers share in the gains?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Acemoglu and Johnson make abundantly clear, they favor technological innovations that increase worker productivity while keeping people employed, which should sustain growth better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But generative AI, in Acemoglu’s view, focuses on mimicking whole people. This yields something he has for years been calling “so-so technology,” applications that perform at best only a little better than humans, but save companies money. Call-center automation is not always more productive than people; it just costs firms less than workers do. AI applications that complement workers seem generally on the back burner of the big tech players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think complementary uses of AI will miraculously appear by themselves unless the industry devotes significant energy and time to them,” Acemoglu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does history suggest about AI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that technologies are often designed to replace workers is the focus of another recent paper by Acemoglu and Johnson, “&lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-economics-091823-025129" target="_blank"&gt;Learning from Ricardo and Thompson: Machinery and Labor in the Early Industrial Revolution — and in the Age of AI&lt;/a&gt;,” published in August in &lt;em&gt;Annual Reviews in Economics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article addresses current debates over AI, especially claims that even if technology replaces workers, the ensuing growth will almost inevitably benefit society widely over time. England during the Industrial Revolution is sometimes cited as a case in point. But Acemoglu and Johnson contend that spreading the benefits of technology does not happen easily. In 19th-century England, they assert, it occurred only after decades of social struggle and worker action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wages are unlikely to rise when workers cannot push for their share of productivity growth,” Acemoglu and Johnson write in the paper. “Today, artificial intelligence may boost average productivity, but it also may replace many workers while degrading job quality for those who remain employed. … The impact of automation on workers today is more complex than an automatic linkage from higher productivity to better wages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper’s title refers to the social historian E.P Thompson and economist David Ricardo; the latter is often regarded as the discipline’s second-most influential thinker ever, after Adam Smith. Acemoglu and Johnson assert that Ricardo’s views went through their own evolution on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“David Ricardo made both his academic work and his political career by arguing that machinery was going to create this amazing set of productivity improvements, and it would be beneficial for society,” Acemoglu says. “And then at some point, he changed his mind, which shows he could be really open-minded. And he started writing about how if machinery replaced labor and didn’t do anything else, it would be bad for workers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This intellectual evolution, Acemoglu and Johnson contend, is telling us something meaningful today: There are not forces that inexorably guarantee broad-based benefits from technology, and we should follow the evidence about AI’s impact, one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the best speed for innovation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If technology helps generate economic growth, then fast-paced innovation might seem ideal, by delivering growth more quickly. But in another paper, “&lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20230353" target="_blank"&gt;Regulating Transformative Technologies&lt;/a&gt;,” from the September issue of &lt;em&gt;American Economic Review: Insights&lt;/em&gt;, Acemoglu and MIT doctoral student Todd Lensman suggest an alternative outlook. If some technologies contain both benefits and drawbacks, it is best to adopt them at a more measured tempo, while those problems are being mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If social damages are large and proportional to the new technology’s productivity, a higher growth rate paradoxically leads to slower optimal adoption,” the authors write in the paper. Their model suggests that, optimally, adoption should happen more slowly at first and then accelerate over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Market fundamentalism and technology fundamentalism might claim you should always go at the maximum speed for technology,” Acemoglu says. “I don’t think there’s any rule like that in economics. More deliberative thinking, especially to avoid harms and pitfalls, can be justified.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those harms and pitfalls could include damage to the job market, or the rampant spread of misinformation. Or&amp;nbsp;AI might harm consumers, in areas from online advertising to online gaming. Acemoglu examines these scenarios in another paper,&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20230589" target="_blank"&gt;When Big Data Enables Behavioral Manipulation&lt;/a&gt;,” forthcoming in &lt;em&gt;American Economic Review: Insights&lt;/em&gt;; it is co-authored with Ali Makhdoumi of Duke University, Azarakhsh Malekian of the University of Toronto, and Asu Ozdaglar of MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we are using it as a manipulative tool, or too much for automation and not enough for providing expertise and information to workers, then we would want a course correction,” Acemoglu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly others might claim innovation has less of a downside or is unpredictable enough that we should not apply any handbrakes to it. And Acemoglu and Lensman, in the September paper, are simply developing a model of innovation adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That model is a response to a trend of the last decade-plus, in which many technologies are hyped are inevitable and celebrated because of their disruption. By contrast, Acemoglu and Lensman are suggesting we can reasonably judge the tradeoffs involved in particular technologies and aim to spur additional discussion about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we reach the right speed for AI adoption?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the idea is to adopt technologies more gradually, how would this occur?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, Acemoglu says, “government regulation has that role.” However, it is not clear what kinds of long-term guidelines for AI might be adopted in the U.S. or around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, he adds, if the cycle of “hype” around AI diminishes, then the rush to use it “will naturally slow down.” This may well be more likely than regulation, if AI does not produce profits for firms soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reason why we’re going so fast is the hype from venture capitalists and other investors, because they think we’re going to be closer to artificial general intelligence,” Acemoglu says. “I think that hype is making us invest badly in terms of the technology, and many businesses are being influenced too early, without knowing what to do. We wrote that paper to say, look, the macroeconomics of it will benefit us if we are more deliberative and understanding about what we’re doing with this technology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this sense, Acemoglu emphasizes, hype is a tangible aspect of the economics of AI, since it drives investment in a particular vision of AI, which influences the AI tools we may encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The faster you go, and the more hype you have, that course correction becomes less likely,” Acemoglu says. “It’s very difficult, if you’re driving 200 miles an hour, to make a 180-degree turn.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Samurai in Japan, then engineers at MIT</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 1867, five Japanese students took a long sea voyage to Massachusetts for some advanced schooling. The group included a 13-year-old named Eiichirō&amp;nbsp;Honma, who was from one of the samurai families that ruled Japan. Honma expected to become a samurai warrior himself, and enrolled in a military academy in Worcester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then some unexpected things happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan’s ruling dynasty, the shogunate that had run the country since the 17th century, lost power. No longer obligated to become a warrior, Honma found himself free to try other things in life. In 1870, he enrolled in the recently opened Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied civil engineering. By 1874, Honma had become MIT’s first graduate from Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Honma may have thought he was going to be a military officer, but by the time he got to MIT he wanted to do something else,” says Hiromu Nagahara, an associate professor of history at MIT. “And that something else was the hottest technology of its time: railroads.” Indeed, Honma returned to Japan and became a celebrated engineer of rail lines, including one through the mountainous Usai Pass in central Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, 150 years after he graduated, Honma is a central part of an exhibit about MIT’s earliest Japanese students, “&lt;a href="https://libraries.mit.edu/exhibits/exhibit/from-samurai-into-engineers/" target="_blank"&gt;From Samurai into Engineers&lt;/a&gt;,” which runs through Dec. 19 at Hayden Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibit features two other early MIT graduates from Japan. Takuma Dan, Class of 1878, was also from a samurai household, studied mining engineering at MIT, and eventually became prominent in Japan as head of the Mitsui corporation. Kiyoko Makino was the first Japanese woman and&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;the first female international student to enroll at MIT, where she studied biology from 1903 to 1905, later becoming a teacher and textbook author in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracing their lives sheds light on interesting careers — and illuminates a historical period in which MIT was reaching prominence, Japan was opening itself to the world, and modern life was rolling forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we look at Eiichirō&amp;nbsp;Honma, Takuma Dan, and Kiyoko Makino, their lives fit the larger context of the relationship between America and Japan,” says Nagahara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The making of “From Samurai into Engineers” was a collective effort, partly generated through MIT course 21H.155/21G.555 (Modern Japan), taught by Nagahara in the spring of 2024. Students contributed to the research and wrote short historical summaries incorporated into the exhibition. The exhibit draws on original archival materials, such as the students’ letters, theses, problem sets, and other documents. Honma’s drawings for an iron girder railroad bridge, as part of his own MIT thesis, are on display, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others on campus significantly collaborated on the project from its inception. Christine Pilcavage, managing director of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://misti.mit.edu/mit-japan" target="_blank"&gt;MIT-Japan Program&lt;/a&gt;, helped encourage the development of the effort, having held an ongoing interest in the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m in awe of this relationship that we’ve had since the first Japanese students were at MIT,” Pilcavage says. “We’ve had this long connection. It shows that MIT as an Institute is always innovating. Each side had much to gain, from Honma coming to MIT, learning technology, and returning to Japan, while also mentoring other students, including Dan.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the research was facilitated by MIT Libraries and its Distinctive Collections holdings, which contain the archives used for the project. Amanda Hawk, who is the public services manager in the library system, worked with Nagahara to facilitate the research by the class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Distinctive Collections is excited to support faculty and student projects related to MIT history, particularly those that illuminate unknown stories or underrepresented communities,” Hawk says. “It was rewarding to collaborate with Hiromu on ‘From Samurai into Engineers’ to place these students within the context of Japanese history and the development of MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that MIT had students from Japan as soon as 1870 might seem improbable on both ends of this historical connection. MIT opened in 1861 but did not start offering classes until 1865. Still, it was rapidly recognized as a significant locus of technological knowledge. Meanwhile the historic changes in Japan created a small pool of students willing to travel to Massachusetts for education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The birth of MIT in the 1860s coincides with a period of huge political economic and cultural upheaval in Japan,” Nagahara says. “It was a unique moment when there was a both a desire to go overseas and a government willingness to let people go overseas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the experience of the Japanese students at MIT seems to have been fairly smooth from the start, enabling them to have a strong focus on scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Honma seemed to have been quite well-received,” Pilcavage says, who wonders if Honma’s social status — he was occasionally called “prince” — contributed to that. Still, she notes, “He was invited to other people’s homes on Thanksgiving. It didn’t seem like he faced extreme prejudice. The community welcomed him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three Japanese students featured in the exhibit wound up leading distinctive lives. While Honma became a celebrated engineer, Dan was an even higher-profile figure. At MIT, he studied mining engineering with Robert Hollawell Richards, husband of Ellen Swallow Richards, MIT’s first female student and instructor. After starting as a mining engineer at Mitsui in 1888, by 1914 he had become chair of the board of the Mitsui conglomerate. Dan even came back to visit MIT twice as a distinguished alumnus, in 1910 and 1921.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan was also a committed internationalist, who believed in cooperation among nations, in contrast to the rising nationalism often present in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1932, he was shockingly assassinated outside of Mitsui headquarters in Tokyo, a victim of nationalist terrorism. Robert Richards wrote that it was “one of those terrible things which no man in his senses can understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Makino, for her part, led a much quieter life, and her status as an early student was only rediscovered in recent years by librarians working in MIT’s Distinctive Collections materials. After MIT, she returned to Japan and became a high school biology teacher in Tokyo. She also authored a textbook, “Physiology of Women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT archivists and students are continuing to research Makino’s life, and earlier this year also uncovered news articles written about her in New England newspapers while she was in the U.S. Nagahara hopes many people will continue researching MIT’s earliest Japanese students, including Sutejirō Fukuzawa, Class of 1888, the son of a well-known Japanese intellectual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In so doing, we may gain more insight into the ways MIT, universities, and early students played concrete roles in ushering their countries into the new age. As Nagahara reflects about these students, “They’re witnessing both America and Japan become modern nation-states.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as Pilcavage notes, Honma’s status as a railroad builder “is symbolic. We continue to build bridges between our institution and Japan.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Connecting the US Coast Guard to MIT Sloan</title>

  <description><![CDATA[For the past 50 years, the Coast Guard has nominated a senior officer to apply to the MIT Sloan Fellows MBA program. “When you leave MIT Sloan, you want to change the world,” says one alumnus.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Andrew Husband | MIT Sloan School of Management</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Jim Ellis II SM ’80 first learned about a special opportunity for members of the U.S. Coast Guard while stationed in Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My commander had received a notice from headquarters about this opportunity. They were asking for recommendations for an officer who might be interested,” says Ellis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opportunity in question was the MIT Sloan Fellows program, today known as the &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/mit-sloan-fellows-mba-program/introduce-yourself" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Sloan Fellows MBA (SFMBA) program&lt;/a&gt;. Every year for 50 years, the Coast Guard has nominated a service member to apply to the program. Fifty Sloan Fellows and two Management of Technology participants have graduated since 1976, and the 53rd student is currently enrolled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his tour nearly over, Ellis followed his commander’s recommendation to apply. The Coast Guard nominated him and his application to MIT Sloan School of Management was accepted. In 1980, Ellis became the fifth-ever Coast Guard Sloan Fellow to graduate due to the special arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My experience at MIT Sloan has been instrumental throughout my entire career,” says Ellis, who, with his wife Margaret Brady, designated half of their bequest to support graduate fellowships through the &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/alumni/mit-sloan-veterans-fund" title="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/alumni/mit-sloan-veterans-fund" data-outlook-id="d209953c-3195-4cb7-b897-c64f2f3d379f"&gt;MIT Sloan Veterans Fund&lt;/a&gt; and half to establish the &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/27/1074015/james-ellis-ii-sm-80-and-margaret-brady/" target="_blank" title="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/27/1074015/james-ellis-ii-sm-80-and-margaret-brady/" data-outlook-id="6ec4e1f7-3e19-4e28-b5ad-677f7694571a"&gt;Ellis/Brady Family Fund&lt;/a&gt; to support the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The success of the people who have been through the program is a testament to why the Coast Guard continues the program,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The desire to change the world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout its 163-year history, MIT has maintained strong relationships with the U.S. military through programs like the MIT Reserve Officers' Training Corps, the 2N Graduate Program in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-standing collaboration between MIT Sloan and the Coast Guard adds to this history. According to &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/staff/directory/johanna-hising-difabio" target="_blank"&gt;Johanna Hising DiFabio&lt;/a&gt;, assistant dean for executive degree programs at MIT Sloan, it demonstrates the Coast Guard’s dedication to leadership development, as well as the unique benefits MIT Sloan has to offer service members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially evident in the careers of the 52 Coast Guard Sloan Fellow alumni, many of whom the program often invites to speak to current students. “It is inspiring to hear our alumni reflect on how this education has significantly influenced their careers and the considerable impact they have had on the Coast Guard and the global community,” says DiFabio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Captain Anne O’Connell MBA ’19 says, “It is very rewarding to be able to pay it back, to look for those officers coming up behind you who should absolutely be offered the same opportunities, and to help them chart that course. I think it's hugely important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most notable Coast Guard Sloan Fellows is Retired Admiral Thad Allen SM ’89, who served as commandant of the Coast Guard from 2006 to 2010. One of the service’s youngest-ever flag officers, Allen is a figure beloved by current and former guardsmen. As commandant, he embraced new digital technologies, championed further arctic exploration, and solidified relations with the other armed services, federal partners, and private industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you leave MIT Sloan, you want to change the world,” says Allen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by his father, who enlisted after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Allen attended the U.S. Coast Guard Academy and subsequently held various commands at sea and ashore during a career spanning four decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years before the end of his second decade, Allen learned about the Sloan Fellows Program through a service-wide solicitation. “The people I worked for believed this would be a great opportunity, and that it would match with my skill set,” says Allen. With the guidance of his senior captains, he applied to MIT Sloan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen matriculated with a cohort whose members included Carly Fiorina SM ’89, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard; Daniel Hesse SM ’89, former CEO of Sprint; and Robert Malone SM ’89, former chair and president of BP America. Though he initially felt a sharp disconnect between his national service experience and their global private sector knowledge, Allen realized everyone in the cohort were becoming his peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong bonds with global perspectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Allen, many of the Coast Guard Sloan Fellows acknowledge just how powerful their cohorts were when they matriculated, as well as how influential they have remained since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have classmates with giant perspectives and unique expertise in places all over the world. It’s remarkable,” says Retired Commander Catherine Kang MBA ’06, who served as deputy of financial transformation for Allen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of SFMBA candidates come to Cambridge from around the world. For example, the 2023–24 cohort comprised 76 percent international citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Coast Guard Sloan Fellows with decades of domestic experience, their cohort’s global perspectives are as novel as they are informative. As Retired Captain Gregory Sanial SM ’07 explains, “We had students from 30 to 40 different countries, and I had the opportunity to learn a lot about different parts of the world and open up my mind to many different experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Coast Guard, Sanial pursued a doctoral degree in organizational leadership and a career in higher education that, professionally, has kept him stateside. Yet the bonds he built at MIT Sloan remain just as strong and as international as they were when he first arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Coast Guard Sloan Fellows attribute this to the program’s focus on cooperation and social events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What impressed me most when I first got there were the team-building exercises, which made a difference in getting a group of diverse people to really gel and work together,” says Retired Captain Lisa Festa SM ’92, SM ’99. “MIT Sloan takes the time at the beginning to invest in you and to make sure you know the people you’re going through school with for the next year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent Coast Guard Sloan Fellow alumnus, Commander Mark Ketchum MBA ’24, says his cohort’s connections are still fresh, but he believes they will last a lifetime. Considering the testimonies of his predecessors, this may very well be the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My cohort made me stronger, and I would like to think that I imparted my strengths onto my classmates,” says Ketchum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big challenges with high impacts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before earning the Coast Guard’s nomination and an acceptance letter from the SFMBA program, potential Sloan Fellows have already served in various leadership positions. Once they graduate, the recognition and distinction that comes with an MIT Sloan degree is quick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, too, are the more challenging leadership tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduation, Allen served as deputy program manager for the Coast Guard’s shipbuilding program at the behest of the then-commandant. “For the agency head to say, ‘This is a bad problem, so I’m picking the next graduate from MIT Sloan,’ is indicative of the program’s cachet value,” he says. Allen then served in the office of budget and programs, a challenging and rewarding post that has become a hub for Coast Guard Sloan Fellows past, present, and future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Rear Admiral Jason Tama MBA ’11 and Captain Brian Erickson MBA ’21, both of whom credit the office with introducing them to the vigorous work ethic necessary for both obtaining an MIT Sloan education and for becoming an effective leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Never in a thousand years would I have gone on the resource management path until a mentor told me it would be one of the most challenging and high-impact things I could do,” says Tama. “You can never be fully prepared for the Sloan Fellows experience, but it can and will change you for the better. It changed the way I approach problems and challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I owe MIT for the senior-level opportunities I’ve had in this organization, and I will probably owe them for some of the opportunities I may get in the future,” adds Erickson. “You should never, ever say no to this opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the early cohorts of Ellis, Allen, and Festa, to more recent alumni like O’Connell, Kang, and Ketchum, Coast Guard Sloan Fellows from the past half-century echo Erickson and Tama’s sentiments when asked about how MIT Sloan has changed them. Words like “challenge,” “opportunity,” and “impact” are used often and with purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They believe joining the SFMBA program as up-and-coming senior leaders is an incredible opportunity for the individual and the Coast Guard, as well as the MIT community and the world at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am excited to see this tradition carry on,” says Tama. “I hope others who are considering it can see the potential and the value, not only for themselves, but for the Coast Guard as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Participation by U.S. Coast Guard members in this highlight of prior MIT Sloan Fellows is not intended as, and does not constitute an endorsement of, the MIT Sloan Fellows MBA program or MIT by either the Department of Homeland Security or the U.S. Coast Guard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A new MIT initiative aims to elevate human-centered research and teaching, and bring together scholars in the humanities, arts, and social sciences with their colleagues across the Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://shass.mit.edu/human-insight-collaborative/"&gt;MIT Human Insight Collaborative&lt;/a&gt; (MITHIC) launched earlier this fall. A formal kickoff event for MITHIC was held on campus Monday, Oct. 28, before a full audience in MIT’s Huntington Hall (Room 10-250). The event featured a conversation with Min Jin Lee, acclaimed author of&amp;nbsp;“Pachinko,” moderated by Linda Pizzuti Henry SM ’05, co-owner and CEO of Boston Globe Media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Initiative leaders say MITHIC will foster creativity, inquiry, and understanding, amplifying the Institute’s impact on global challenges like climate change, AI, pandemics, poverty, democracy, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;President Sally Kornbluth says MITHIC is the first of a new model known as the MIT Collaboratives, designed among other things to foster and support new collaborations on compelling global problems. The next MIT Collaborative will focus on life sciences and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The MIT Collaboratives will make it easier for our faculty to ‘go big’ — to pursue the most innovative ideas in their disciplines and build connections to other fields,” says Kornbluth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We created MITHIC with a particular focus on the human-centered fields, to help advance research with the potential for global impact. MITHIC also has another, more local aim: to support faculty in developing fresh approaches to teaching and research that will engage and inspire a new generation of students,” Kornbluth adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A transformative opportunity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MITHIC is co-chaired by Anantha Chandrakasan, chief innovation and strategy officer, dean of the School of Engineering, and the Vannevar Bush Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science; and Agustin Rayo, Kenan Sahin Dean of the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (SHASS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“MITHIC is an incredibly exciting and meaningful initiative to me as it represents MIT at its core — bringing broad perspectives and human insights to solve some of the world’s most important problems,” says Chandrakasan. “It offers the opportunity to shape the future of research and education at MIT through advancing core scholarship in the individual humanities, arts, and social sciences disciplines, but also through cross-cutting problem formulation and problem-solving. I have no doubt MITHIC will inspire our community to think differently and work together in ways that will have a lasting impact on society.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Rayo says true innovation must go beyond technology to encompass the full complexity of the human experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“At MIT, we aim to make the world a better place. But you can't make the world a better place unless you understand its full economic, political, social, ethical — human — dimensions,” Rayo says. “MITHIC can help ensure that MIT educates broad-minded students, who are ready for the multidimensional challenges of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Rayo sees MITHIC as a transformative opportunity for MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“MIT needs an integrated approach, which combines STEM with the human-centered disciplines. MITHIC can help catalyze that integration,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mark Gorenberg ’76, chair of the MIT Corporation, says MITHIC represents a commitment to collaboration, a spirit of curiosity, and the belief that uniting the humanities and sciences results in solutions that are not only innovative, but meaningful and lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“MIT has long been a place where boundless ideas and entrepreneurial energy come together to meet the world’s toughest challenges,” Gorenberg says. “With MITHIC, we’re adding a powerful new layer to that mission — one that captures the richness of human experience and imagination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Support for MITHIC comes from all five MIT schools, the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, and the Office of the Provost, along with philanthropic support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Charlene Kabcenell ’79, a life member of the MIT Corporation, and Derry Kabcenell ’75 chose to support MITHIC financially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“MIT produces world-class scientists and technologists, but expertise in the skills of these areas is not enough. We are excited that the collaborations catalyzed by this initiative will help our graduates to stay mindful of the impact of their work on people and society,” they say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ray Stata ’57, MIT Corporation life member emeritus, is also a benefactor of MITHIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“﻿In industry, it is not just technical innovation and breakthroughs that win, but also culture, in the ways people collaborate and work together. These are skills and behaviors that can be learned through a deeper understanding of humanities and social sciences. This has always been an important part of MIT’s education and I am happy to see the renewed attention being given to this aspect of the learning experience,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“A potential game changer”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Keeril Makan, associate dean for strategic initiatives in SHASS and the Michael (1949) and Sonja Koerner Music Composition Professor, is the faculty lead for MITHIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“MITHIC is about incentivizing collaboration, not research in specific areas,” says Makan. “It’s a ground-up approach, where we support faculty based upon the research that is of interest to them, which they identify.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MITHIC consists of three new funding opportunities for faculty, the largest of which is the SHASS+ Connectivity Fund. For all three funds, proposals can be for projects ready to begin, as well as planning grants in preparation for future proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The SHASS+ Connectivity Fund will support research that bridges between SHASS fields and other fields at MIT. Proposals require a project lead in SHASS and another project lead whose primary appointment is outside of SHASS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The SHASS+ Connectivity Fund is co-chaired by David Kaiser, the Germehausen Professor of the History of Science and professor of physics, and Maria Yang, deputy dean of engineering and Kendall Rohsenow Professor of Mechanical Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“MIT has set an ambitious agenda for itself focused on addressing extremely complex and challenging problems facing society today, such as climate change, and there is a critical role for technological solutions to address these problems,” Yang says. “However, the origin of these problems are in part&amp;nbsp; due to humans, so humanistic considerations need&amp;nbsp;to be part of the solution. Such problems cannot be conquered by technology alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Yang says the goal of the SHASS+ Connectivity Fund is to enhance MIT’s research by building interdisciplinary teams, embedding a human-centered focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“My hope is that these collaborations will build bridges between SHASS and the rest of MIT, and will lead to integrated research that is more powerful and meaningful together,” says Yang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Proposals for the first round of projects are due Nov. 22, but MITHIC is already bringing MIT faculty together to share ideas in hopes of sparking ideas for potential collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;An information session and networking reception was held in September. MITHIC has also been hosting a series of “Meeting of the Minds” events. Makan says these have been opportunities for faculty and teaching staff to make connections around a specific topic or area of interest with colleagues they haven’t previously worked with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Recent Meeting of the Minds sessions have been held on topics like cybersecurity, social history of math, food security, and rebuilding Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Faculty are already educating each other about their disciplines,” says Makan. “What happens in SHASS has been opaque to faculty in the other schools, just as the research in the other schools has been opaque to the faculty in SHASS. We’ve seen progress with initiatives like the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/"&gt;Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing&lt;/a&gt; (SERC), when it comes to computing. MITHIC will broaden that scope.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The leadership of MITHIC is cross-disciplinary, with a steering committee of faculty representing all five schools and the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Iain Cheeseman, the Herman and Margaret Sokol Professor of Biology, is a member of the MITHIC steering committee. He says that while he continues to be amazed and inspired by the diverse research and work from across MIT, there’s potential to go even further by working together and connecting across diverse perspectives, ideas, and approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The bold goal and mission of MITHIC, to connect the humanities at MIT to work being conducted across the other schools at MIT, feels like a potential game-changer,” he says. “I am really excited to see the unexpected new work and directions that come out of this initiative, including hopefully connections that persist and transform the work across MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhancing the arts and humanities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In addition to the SHASS+ Connectivity Fund, MITHIC has two funds aimed specifically at enhancing research and teaching within SHASS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Humanities Cultivation Fund will support projects from the humanities and arts in SHASS. It is co-chaired by Arthur Bahr, professor of literature, and Anne McCants, the Ann F. Friedlaender Professor of History and SHASS research chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Humanistic scholarship and artistic creation have long been among MIT’s hidden gems. The Humanities Cultivation Fund offers an exciting new opportunity to not only allow such work to continue to flourish, but also to give it greater visibility across the MIT community and into the wider world of scholarship. The fund aspires to cultivate — that is, to seed and nurture — new ideas and modes of inquiry into the full spectrum of human culture and expression,” says McCants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The SHASS Education Innovation Fund will support new educational approaches in SHASS fields. The fund is co-chaired by Eric Klopfer, professor of comparative media studies/writing, and Emily Richmond Pollock, associate professor of music and SHASS undergraduate education chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Pollock says the fund is a welcome chance to support colleagues who have a strong sense of where teaching in SHASS could go next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We are looking for efforts that address contemporary challenges of teaching and learning, with approaches that can be tested in a specific context and later applied across the school. The crucial role of SHASS in educating MIT students in&amp;nbsp;all fields means that what we devise here in our curriculum can have huge benefits for the Institute as a whole.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Makan says infusing MIT’s human-centered disciplines with support is an essential part of MITHIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The stronger these units are, the more the human-centered disciplines permeate the student experience, ultimately helping to build a stronger, more inclusive MIT,” says Makan.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Katherine Ouellette | MIT Open Learning</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-46d5b4c6-7fff-83d2-89db-af068dba7e19"&gt;&lt;em&gt;As educators are challenged to balance student learning and well-being with planning authentic and relevant course materials, MIT pK-12 at Open Learning developed a framework that can help. The student-centered STEAM learning architecture, initially&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/revolutionary-bold-educational-endeavor-belize-0326"&gt;&lt;em&gt;co-created for Itz’at STEAM Academy in Belize&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, now serves as a model for schools worldwide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three core pillars guide MIT pK-12’s vision for teaching and learning: social-emotional and cultural learning, transdisciplinary academics, and community engagement. Claudia Urrea, principal investigator for this project and senior associate director of MIT pK-12, says this innovative framework supports learners’ growth as engaged and self-directed students. Joining these efforts on the pK-12 team are Joe Diaz, program coordinator, and Emily Glass, senior learning innovation designer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now that Itz’at has completed its first academic year, the MIT pK-12 team reflects on how the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2024-03/Learning_Architecture_White_Paper_FINAL.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;STEAM learning architecture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; works in practice and how it could be adapted to other schools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Why would a new school need a STEAM learning architecture? How is this framework used?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glass:&lt;/strong&gt; In the case of&amp;nbsp;Itz’at STEAM Academy, the school aims to prepare its students for careers and jobs of the future, recognizing that learners will be navigating an evolving global economy with significant technological changes. Since the local and global landscape will continue to evolve over time, in order to stay innovative, the STEAM learning architecture serves as a reference document for the school to reflect, iterate, and improve its program. Learners will need to think critically, solve large problems, embrace creativity, and utilize digital technologies and tools to their benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How do you begin developing a school from scratch?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urrea:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;To build a school that reflected local values and aspired towards global goals, our team knew we needed a deep understanding of the strengths and needs of Belize’s larger education ecosystem and culture. We collaborated with Belize's Ministry of Education, Culture, Science, and Technology, as well as the newly hired Itz’at staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Next, we conducted an extensive review of research, drawing from MIT pK-12’s own work and outside academic studies on competency-based education, constructionism, and other foundational pedagogies. We gathered best practices of innovative schools through interviews and global site visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT’s collective team experience included the creation of schools for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://nuvux.nuvustudio.com/history"&gt;NuVuX network&lt;/a&gt;, constructionist pedagogical research and practice, and the development of STEAM-focused educational materials for both formal and informal learning environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Why was co-creation important for this process?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urrea:&lt;/strong&gt; MIT pK-12 could not imagine doing this project without strong co-creation. Everyone involved has their own expertise and understanding of what works best for learners and educators, and collaborating ensures that all stakeholders have a voice in the school’s pedagogy. We co-designed an innovative framework that’s relevant to Belize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;However, there’s no one-size-fits-all pedagogy that will be successful in every context. This framework allows educators to adapt their approaches. The school and the ministry can sustain Itz’at’s experimental nature with continual reflection, iteration, and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What was the reasoning behind the framework’s core pillars?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glass:&lt;/strong&gt; MIT pK-12 found that many successful schools had strong social-emotional support, specific approaches to academics, and reciprocal relationships with their surrounding communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We tailored each core pillar to Itz’at. To better support learners’ social-emotional well-being, Belizean cultural identity is an essential part of the learning needed to anchor this project locally. A transdisciplinary approach most clearly aligns with the school’s focus on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, encouraging learners to ask big questions facing the world today. And to engage learners in real-world learning experiences, the school coordinates internships with the local community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Which areas of learning science research were most significant to the STEAM architecture? How does this pedagogy differ from Itz’at educators’ previous experiences?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urrea:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learning at the Itz'at STEAM Academy focuses on authentic learning experiences and concrete evidence of concept mastery. Educators say that this is different from other schools in Belize, where conventional grading is based on rote memorization in isolated academic subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Together as a team, Itz’at educators shifted their teaching to follow the foundational principles from the STEAM learning architecture, both bringing in their own experiences and implementing new practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glass:&lt;/strong&gt; Itz’at’s competency-based approach promotes a more holistic educational experience. Instead of traditional subjects like science, history, math, and language arts, Itz’at classes cover sustainable environments, global humanities, qualitative reasoning, arts and fabrication, healthy living, and real-world learning. Combining disciplines in multiple ways allows learners to draw stronger connections between different subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diaz: &lt;/strong&gt;When the curriculum is relevant to learners’ lives, learners can also more easily connect what happens inside and outside of the classroom. Itz’at educators embraced bringing in experts from the local community to enrich learning experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;How does the curriculum support learners with career preparation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diaz: &lt;/strong&gt;To ensure learners can transition smoothly from school to the workforce, Itz’at offers exposure to potential careers early in their journey. Internships with local businesses, community organizations, and government agencies provide learners with real-world experience in professional environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Students begin preparing for internships in their second year and attend seminars in their third year. By their fourth and final year, they are expected to begin internships and capstone projects that demonstrate academic rigor, innovative thinking, and mastery of concepts, topics, and skills of their choosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you hope the impact of the STEAM architecture will be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glass: &lt;/strong&gt;Our hope is that the STEAM learning architecture will serve as a resource for educators, school administrators, policymakers, and researchers beyond Belize. This framework can help educational practitioners respond to critical challenges, including preparation for life and careers, thinking beyond short-term outcomes, learners’ mental health and well-being, and more.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Artist and designer Es Devlin is the recipient of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://arts.mit.edu/mcdermott/"&gt;2025 Eugene McDermott Award in the Arts at MIT&lt;/a&gt;. The $100,000 prize, to be awarded at a gala in her honor, also includes an artist residency at MIT in spring 2025, during which Es Devlin will present her work in a lecture open to the public on May 1, 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Devlin’s work explores biodiversity, linguistic diversity, and collective AI-generated poetry, all areas that also are being explored within the MIT community. She is known for public art and installations at major museums such as the Tate Modern, kinetic stage designs for the Metropolitan Opera, the Super Bowl, and the Olympics, as well as monumental stage sculptures for large-scale stadium concerts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I am always most energized by works I have not yet made, so I am immensely grateful to have this trust and investment in ideas I’ve yet to conceive,” says Devlin. “I’m honored to receive an award that has been granted to so many of my heroes, and look forward to collaborating closely with the brilliant minds at MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We look forward to presenting Es Devlin with MIT’s highest award in the arts. Her work will be an inspiration for our students studying the visual arts, theater, media, and design. Her interest in AI and the arts dovetails with a major initiative at MIT to address the societal impact of GenAI [generative artificial intelligence],” says MIT vice provost and Ford International Professor of History Philip S. Khoury. “With a new performing arts center opening this winter and a campus-wide arts festival taking place this spring, there could not be a better moment to expose MIT’s creative community to Es Devlin’s extraordinary artistic practice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Eugene McDermott Award in the Arts at MIT recognizes innovative artists working in any field or cross-disciplinary activity. The $100,000 prize represents an investment in the recipient’s future creative work, rather than a prize for a particular project or lifetime of achievement. The official announcement was made at the Council for the Arts at MIT’s 51st annual meeting on Oct. 24. Since it was established in 1974, the award has been bestowed upon 38 individuals who work in performing, visual, and media arts, as well as authors, art historians, and patrons of the arts. Past recipients include Santiago Calatrava, Gustavo Dudamel, Olafur Eliasson, Robert Lepage, Audra McDonald, Suzan-Lori Parks, Bill Viola, and Pamela Z, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A distinctive feature of the award is a short residency at MIT, which includes a public presentation of the artist’s work, substantial interaction with students and faculty, and a gala that convenes national and international leaders in the arts. The goal of the residency is to provide the recipient with unparalleled access to the creative energy and cutting-edge research at the Institute and to develop mutually enlightening relationships in the MIT community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Eugene McDermott Award in the Arts at MIT was established in 1974 by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://arts.mit.edu/opportunities/giving-to-the-arts-at-mit/margaret-mcdermott/"&gt;Margaret McDermott&lt;/a&gt; (1912-2018) in honor of her husband, Eugene McDermott (1899-1973), a co-founder of Texas Instruments and longtime friend and benefactor of MIT. The award is presented by the Council for the Arts at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The award is bestowed upon individuals whose artistic trajectory and body of work have achieved the highest distinction in their field and indicate they will remain leaders for years to come. The McDermott Award reflects MIT’s commitment to risk-taking, problem-solving, and connecting creative minds across disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Es Devlin, born in London in 1971, views an audience as a temporary society and often invites public participation in communal choral works. Her canvas ranges from public sculptures and installations at Tate Modern, V&amp;amp;A, Serpentine, Imperial War Museum, and Lincoln Center, to kinetic stage designs at the Royal Opera House, the National Theatre, and the Metropolitan Opera, as well as Olympic ceremonies, Super Bowl halftime shows, and monumental illuminated stage sculptures for large-scale stadium concerts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Devlin is the subject of a major monographic book,&amp;nbsp;“An Atlas of Es Devlin,” described by Thames and Hudson as their most intricate and sculptural publication to date, and a retrospective exhibition at the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum in New York. In 2020, she became the first female architect of the U.K. Pavilion at a World Expo, conceiving a building which used AI to co-author poetry with visitors on its 20-meter diameter facade. Her practice was the subject of the 2015 Netflix documentary series&amp;nbsp;“Abstract: The Art of Design.” She is a fellow of the Royal Academy of Music, University of the Arts London, and a Royal Designer for Industry at the Royal Society of Arts. She has been awarded the London Design Medal, three Olivier Awards, a Tony Award, an Ivor Novello Award, doctorates from the Universities of Bristol and Kent, and a Commander of the Order of the British Empire award.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>3 Questions: Can we secure a sustainable supply of nickel?</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2024/3-questions-can-we-secure-sustainable-supply-nickel-1101</link>
  <description><![CDATA[Extraction of nickel, an essential component of clean energy technologies, needs stronger policies to protect local environments and communities, MIT researchers say.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>David L. Chandler | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As the world strives to cut back on carbon emissions, demand for minerals and metals needed for clean energy technologies is growing rapidly, sometimes straining existing supply chains and harming local environments. In a new study &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435124004586?dgcid=coauthor" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;published today in &lt;/em&gt;Joule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Elsa Olivetti, a professor of materials science and engineering and director of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://climateproject.mit.edu/missions" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decarbonizing Energy and Industry mission&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; within &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://climateproject.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT’s Climate Project&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, along with recent graduates Basuhi Ravi PhD ’23 and Karan Bhuwalka PhD ’24 and nine others, examine the case of nickel, which is an essential element for some electric vehicle batteries and parts of some solar panels and wind turbines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How robust is the supply of this vital metal, and what are the implications of its extraction for the local environments, economies, and communities in the places where it is mined?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; asked Olivetti, Ravi, and Bhuwalka to explain their findings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Why is nickel becoming more important in the clean energy economy, and what are some of the potential issues in its supply chain?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Olivetti:&lt;/strong&gt; Nickel is increasingly important for its role in EV batteries, as well as other technologies such as wind and solar. For batteries, high-purity nickel sulfate is a key input to the cathodes of EV batteries, which enables high energy density in batteries and increased driving range for EVs. As the world transitions away from fossil fuels, the demand for EVs, and consequently for nickel, has increased dramatically and is projected to continue to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nickel supply chain for battery-grade nickel sulfate includes mining nickel from ore deposits, processing it to a suitable nickel intermediary, and refining it to nickel sulfate. The potential issues in the supply chain can be broadly described as land use concerns in the mining stage, and emissions concerns in the processing stage. This is obviously oversimplified, but as a basic structure for our inquiry we thought about it this way. Nickel mining is land-intensive, leading to deforestation, displacement of communities, and potential contamination of soil and water resources from mining waste. In the processing step, the use of fossil fuels leads to direct emissions including particulate matter and sulfur oxides. In addition, some emerging processing pathways are particularly energy-intensive, which can double the carbon footprint of nickel-rich batteries compared to the current average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What is Indonesia’s role in the global nickel supply, and what are the consequences of nickel extraction there and in other major supply countries?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ravi:&lt;/strong&gt; Indonesia plays a critical role in nickel supply, holding the world's largest nickel reserves and supplying nearly half of the globally mined nickel in 2023. The country's nickel production has seen a remarkable tenfold increase since 2016. This production surge has fueled economic growth in some regions, but also brought notable environmental and social impacts to nickel mining and processing areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nickel mining expansion in Indonesia has been linked to health impacts due to air pollution in the islands where nickel processing is prominent, as well as deforestation in some of the most biodiversity-rich locations on the planet. Reports of displacement of indigenous communities, land grabbing, water rights issues, and inadequate job quality in and around mines further highlight the social concerns and unequal distribution of burdens and benefits in Indonesia. Similar concerns exist in other major nickel-producing countries, where mining activities can negatively impact the environment, disrupt livelihoods, and exacerbate inequalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a global scale, Indonesia’s reliance on coal-based energy for nickel processing, particularly in energy-intensive smelting and leaching of a clay-like material called laterite, results in a high carbon intensity for nickel produced in the region, compared to other major producing regions such as Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What role can industry and policymakers play in helping to meet growing demand while improving environmental safety?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bhuwalka:&lt;/strong&gt; In consuming countries, policies can foster “discerning demand,” which means creating incentives for companies to source nickel from producers that prioritize sustainability. This can be achieved through regulations that establish acceptable environmental footprints for imported materials, such as limits on carbon emissions from nickel production. For example, the EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act and the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act could be leveraged to promote responsible sourcing. Additionally, governments can use their purchasing power to favor sustainably produced nickel in public procurement, which could influence industry practices and encourage the adoption of sustainability standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the supply side, nickel-producing countries like Indonesia can implement policies to mitigate the adverse environmental and social impacts of nickel extraction. This includes strengthening environmental regulations and enforcement to reduce the footprint of mining and processing, potentially through stricter pollution limits and responsible mine waste management. In addition, supporting community engagement, implementing benefit-sharing mechanisms, and investing in cleaner nickel processing technologies are also crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internationally, harmonizing sustainability standards and facilitating capacity building and technology transfer between developed and developing countries can create a level playing field and prevent unsustainable practices. Responsible investment practices by international financial institutions, favoring projects that meet high environmental and social standards, can also contribute to a stable and sustainable nickel supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2024/presidential-portrait-l-rafael-reif-unveiled-1031</guid>
        <dc:creator>Kathy Wren | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new portrait marks the legacy of L. Rafael Reif, MIT’s president from 2012 to 2022. Painted by Jon Friedman, the portrait was unveiled at a recent gathering at Gray House, where portraits of many of Reif’s predecessors also adorn the walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unveiling served as something of a reunion for many MIT faculty and staff members who had worked closely with Reif at various points in his four decades at MIT, especially his decade as president. It also featured several generations of the Reif family and special friends such as cellist Yo-Yo Ma. Susan Whitehead, a life member of the MIT Corporation and life board member of the Whitehead Institute, and Ray Stata ’57, SM ’58, co-founder of Analog Devices, gave remarks honoring Reif and his impact at the Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT President Sally Kornbluth opened the event by welcoming the audience to the president’s residence on campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we all know, Gray House belongs to the MIT community, which means that each family who lives here takes responsibility for stewarding the place for the future. Which, in a grander sense, is a pretty good way of describing what it means to be president of MIT,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applauding the “many grand things he set in motion,” Kornbluth described several of Reif’s impactful achievements as&amp;nbsp;MIT’s 17th president, such as establishing the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-reshapes-itself-stephen-schwarzman-college-of-computing-1015" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Schwarzman College of Computing&lt;/a&gt;, leading the revitalization of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/new-era-kendall-square-initiative-cambridge-planning-board-0518" target="_blank"&gt;Kendall Square&lt;/a&gt;, and envisioning and launching&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/mit-announces-the-engine-for-entrepreneurs-1026" target="_blank"&gt;The Engine&lt;/a&gt;, MIT’s venture firm for “tough tech.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each of those achievements helped prime MIT for the future, and each one has had powerful positive effects well beyond our community too,” Kornbluth said, noting that the term “tough tech” didn’t even exist before the establishment of The Engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MIT has been an exceptional place from the very start, and it has had quite a few visionary presidents. But there is no question that MIT was more exceptional when Rafael finished&amp;nbsp;than when he began. And we owe him a great debt of gratitude,” Kornbluth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information about the Reif presidency can be found in &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/rafael-reif-to-step-down-mit-president-0210" target="_blank"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; written when Reif announced his decision to step down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the portrait was unveiled, Ma performed a short piece by Johann Sebastian Bach on the cello. Afterward, Stata offered a comprehensive personal and historical perspective on Reif’s wide-ranging contributions to MIT and the nation, including his key role in establishing MIT’s footing in the semiconductor landscape, and in demonstrating and advocating for the critical role of academic research in advancing the development&amp;nbsp;of the U.S. semiconductor sector. Whitehead followed, highlighting a range of Reif’s accomplishments during his tenure as MIT president, including establishing the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2012/mit-launching-imes-0202" target="_blank"&gt;Institute for Medical Engineering and Science&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2014/new-building-will-be-hub-for-nanoscale-research-0429" target="_blank"&gt;MIT.nano&lt;/a&gt;, leading the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/campaign-better-world-finish-0930" target="_blank"&gt;Campaign for a Better World&lt;/a&gt;, overseeing the redevelopment of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2017/agreement-redevelop-volpe-center-kendall-square-0118" target="_blank"&gt;Volpe Center&lt;/a&gt; in Kendall Square, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of the above was made possible because you are a remarkable synthesizer and builder,” she said. “We watched as you grappled with questions, listened carefully, inside and outside of MIT, and then you moved. You were bold once you had synthesized. None of the above initiatives would have happened without your decisive big thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitehead also praised Reif’s kindness and empathy, noting the many decisions he oversaw to promote student wellbeing at MIT and acknowledging his leadership during difficult times, such as the death of MIT Police Officer Sean Collier. She closed by reminding the crowd of the Institute-wide farewell &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/dance-party-reif-0919" target="_blank"&gt;dance party&lt;/a&gt; he hosted as he stepped down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Reif took to the podium, he thanked the speakers as well as other members of the audience, including Corporation Life Member Fariboz Maseeh ScD ’90; Reif was the inaugural holder of the Fariborz Maseeh Professorship of Emerging Technology before becoming MIT’s president. He also thanked his wife, Christine — whose own portrait, also painted by Friedman, now hangs in the Emma Rogers Room (Room 10-340) — for her support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="/sites/default/files/images/inline/MIT-Reif-Portrait-02-press.jpg" data-align="center" data-entity-uuid="b5170272-bda2-4505-9c7a-51869ea9a549" data-entity-type="file" alt="L. Rafael and Christine Reif stand next to the portrait." width="2333" height="3500" data-caption="L. Rafael and Christine Reif stand next to his portrait. Both had portraits painted by Jon Friedman."&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reif recalled some of his favorite memories of living at Gray House, including hosting his grandchildren for sleepovers at what they called “the Castle” and partaking in a snowball fight with students on Killian Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each and every one of you influenced my thinking, gave me intellectual breadth, suffered my sense of humor, and shaped the person I became,” Reif said. “So, whatever qualities you believe you see captured in Mr. Friedman’s portrait, please realize that all of you are represented there too, in your brilliance and your goodness. It has been a tremendous privilege to be part of the MIT family for all these years.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Wearable devices like smartwatches and fitness trackers interact with parts of our bodies to measure and learn from internal processes, such as our heart rate or sleep stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, MIT researchers have developed wearable devices that may be able to perform similar functions for individual cells inside the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These battery-free, subcellular-sized devices, made of a soft polymer, are designed to gently wrap around different parts of neurons, such as axons and dendrites, without damaging the cells, upon wireless actuation with light. By snugly wrapping neuronal processes, they could be used to measure or modulate a neuron’s electrical and metabolic activity at a subcellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these devices are wireless and free-floating, the researchers envision that thousands of tiny devices could someday be injected and then actuated noninvasively using light. Researchers would precisely control how the wearables gently wrap around cells, by manipulating the dose of light shined from outside the body, which would penetrate the tissue and actuate the devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By enfolding axons that transmit electrical impulses between neurons and to other parts of the body, these wearables could help restore some neuronal degradation that occurs in diseases like multiple sclerosis. In the long run, the devices could be integrated with other materials to create tiny circuits that could measure and modulate individual cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The concept and platform technology we introduce here is like a founding stone that brings about immense possibilities for future research,” says Deblina Sarkar, the AT&amp;amp;T Career Development Assistant Professor in the MIT Media Lab and Center for Neurobiological Engineering, head of the Nano-Cybernetic Biotrek Lab, and the senior author of a paper on this technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarkar is joined on the paper by lead author Marta J. I. Airaghi Leccardi, a former MIT postdoc who is now a Novartis Innovation Fellow; Benoît X. E. Desbiolles, an MIT postdoc; Anna Y. Haddad ’23, who was an MIT undergraduate researcher during the work; and MIT graduate students Baju C. Joy and Chen Song. The research &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-024-01335-8" target="_blank"&gt;appears today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications Chemistry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snugly wrapping cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain cells have complex shapes, which makes it exceedingly difficult to create a bioelectronic implant that can tightly conform to neurons or neuronal processes. For instance, axons are slender, tail-like structures that attach to the cell body of neurons, and their length and curvature vary widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, axons and other cellular components are fragile, so any device that interfaces with them must be soft enough to make good contact without harming them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome these challenges, the MIT researchers developed thin-film devices from a soft polymer called azobenzene, that don’t damage cells they enfold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to a material transformation, thin sheets of azobenzene will roll when exposed to light, enabling them to wrap around cells. Researchers can precisely control the direction and diameter of the rolling by varying the intensity and polarization of the light, as well as the shape of the devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thin films can form tiny microtubes with diameters that are less than a micrometer. This enables them to gently, but snugly, wrap around highly curved axons and dendrites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is possible to very finely control the diameter of the rolling. You can stop if when you reach a particular dimension you want by tuning the light energy accordingly,” Sarkar explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers experimented with several fabrication techniques to find a process that was scalable and wouldn’t require the use of a semiconductor clean room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making microscopic wearables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They begin by depositing a drop of azobenzene onto a sacrificial layer composed of a water-soluble material. Then the researchers press a stamp onto the drop of polymer to mold thousands of tiny devices on top of the sacrificial layer. The stamping technique enables them to create complex structures, from rectangles to flower shapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A baking step ensures all solvents are evaporated and then they use etching to scrape away any material that remains between individual devices. Finally, they dissolve the sacrificial layer in water, leaving thousands of microscopic devices freely floating in the liquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once they have a solution with free-floating devices, they wirelessly actuated the devices with light to induce the devices to roll. They found that free-floating structures can maintain their shapes for days after illumination stops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a series of experiments to ensure the entire method is biocompatible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After perfecting the use of light to control rolling, they tested the devices on rat neurons and found they could tightly wrap around even highly curved axons and dendrites without causing damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To have intimate interfaces with these cells, the devices must be soft and able to conform to these complex structures. That is the challenge we solved in this work. We were the first to show that azobenzene could even wrap around living cells,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the biggest challenges they faced was developing a scalable fabrication process that could be performed outside a clean room. They also iterated on the ideal thickness for the devices, since making them too thick causes cracking when they roll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because azobenzene is an insulator, one direct application is using the devices as synthetic myelin for axons that have been damaged. Myelin is an insulating layer that wraps axons and allows electrical impulses to travel efficiently between neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In non-myelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis, neurons lose some insulating myelin sheets. There is no biological way of regenerating them. By acting as synthetic myelin, the wearables might help restore neuronal function in MS patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also demonstrated how the devices can be combined with optoelectrical materials that can stimulate cells. Moreover, atomically thin materials can be patterned on top of the devices, which can still roll to form microtubes without breaking. This opens up opportunities for integrating sensors and circuits in the devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, because they make such a tight connection with cells, one could use very little energy to stimulate subcellular regions. This could enable a researcher or clinician to modulate electrical activity of neurons for treating brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is exciting to demonstrate this symbiosis of an artificial device with a cell at an unprecedented resolution. We have shown that this technology is possible,” Sarkar says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to exploring these applications, the researchers want to try functionalizing the device surfaces with molecules that would enable them to target specific cell types or subcellular regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work is an exciting step toward new symbiotic neural interfaces acting at the level of the individual axons and synapses. When integrated with nanoscale 1- and 2D conductive nanomaterials, these light-responsive azobenzene sheets could become a versatile platform to sense and deliver different types of signals (i.e., electrical, optical, thermal, etc.) to neurons and other types of cells in a minimally or noninvasive manner. Although preliminary, the cytocompatibility data reported in this work is also very promising for future use &lt;em&gt;&lt;i data-stringify-type="italic"&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,” says Flavia Vitale, associate professor of neurology, bioengineering, and physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University of Pennsylvania, who was not involved with this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation and the U.S. National Institutes of Health Brain Initiative. This work was carried out, in part, through the use of&amp;nbsp;MIT.nano facilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-cd22a14f-7fff-72b3-9e07-e69dd976f3ae"&gt;What is it like to give birth on Mars? Can bioengineer TikTok stars win at the video game “Super Smash Brothers” while also answering questions about science? How do sheep, mouse, and human brains compare? These questions and others were asked last month when more than 50,000 visitors from across Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Greater Boston participated in the MIT Museum’s annual Cambridge Science Festival, a week-long celebration dedicated to creativity, ingenuity, and innovation. Running Monday, Sept. 23 through Sunday, Sept. 29, the 2024 edition was the largest in its history, with a dizzyingly diverse program spanning more than 300 events presented in more than 75 different venues, all free and open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Presented in partnership with the City of Cambridge and more than 250 collaborators across Greater Boston, this year’s festival comprised a wide range of interactive programs for adults, children, and families, including workshops, demos, keynote lectures, walking tours, professional networking opportunities, and expert panels. Aimed at scientists and non-scientists alike, the festival also collaborated with several local schools to offer visits from an astronaut for middle- and high-school students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With support from dozens of local organizations, the festival was the first iteration to happen under the new leadership of Michael John Gorman, who was appointed director of the MIT Museum&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/michael-john-gorman-named-mit-museum-director-0111"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt; and began his position in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“A science festival like this has an incredible ability to unite a diverse array of people and ideas, while also showcasing&amp;nbsp;Cambridge as an internationally recognized leader in science, technology, engineering, and math,” says Gorman. “I'm thrilled to have joined an institution that values producing events that foster such a strong sense of community, and was so excited to see the enthusiastic response from the tens of thousands of people who showed up and made the festival such a success.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The 2024 Cambridge Science Festival was broad in scope, with events ranging from hands-on 3D-printing demos to concerts from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.openspace.mit.edu/calendar/midday-music-mit-laptop-ensemble"&gt;the MIT Laptop Ensemble&lt;/a&gt; to participatory activities at the MIT Museum’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mitmuseum.mit.edu/on-now/drop-in-activities/maker-hub"&gt;Maker Hub&lt;/a&gt;. This year’s programming also highlighted three carefully curated theme tracks that each encompassed more than 25 associated events:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;“For the Win: Games, Puzzles, and the Science of Play” (Thursday) consisted of multiple evening events clustered around Kendall Square.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;“Frontiers: A New Era of Space Exploration” (Friday and Saturday) featured programs throughout Boston and was co-curated by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://spaceconsortium.org/about/"&gt;The Space Consortium&lt;/a&gt;, organizers of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://spaceconsortium.org/space-week-schedule/"&gt;Massachusetts Space Week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;“Electric Skin: Wearable Tech and the Future of Fashion”&amp;nbsp;(Saturday) offered both day and evening events at the intersection of science, fabric, and fashion, taking place at The Foundry and co-curated by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.bostonfashionweek.com/"&gt;Boston Fashion Week&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://affoa.org/"&gt;Advanced Functional Fabrics of America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One of the discussions tied to the games-themed “For the Win” track involved artist Jeremy Couillard speaking with MIT Lecturer Mikael Jakobsson about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cambridgesciencefestival.org/gamematters-jia/"&gt;the larger importance of games&lt;/a&gt; as a construct for encouraging interpersonal interaction and creating meaningful social spaces. Starting this past summer, the List Visual Arts Center has been the home of Couillard’s first-ever&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://listart.mit.edu/exhibitions/list-projects-30-jeremy-couillard"&gt;institutional solo exhibition&lt;/a&gt;, which centers around “Escape from Lavender Island,” a dystopian third-person, open-world exploration game he released in 2023 on the Steam video-game platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For the “Frontiers” space theme, one of the headlining events,&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href="https://cambridgesciencefestival.org/isanyoneoutthere-qgh/"&gt;Is Anyone Out There?&lt;/a&gt;”, tackled the latest cutting-edge research and theories related to the potential existence of extraterrestrial life. The panel of local astronomers and astrophysicists included Sara Seager, the Class of 1941 Professor of Planetary Science, professor of physics, and professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT; Kim Arcand, an expert in astronomic visualization at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics; and Michael Hecht, a research scientist and associate director of research management at MIT’s Haystack Observatory. The researchers spoke about the tools they and their peers use to try to search for extraterrestrial life, and what discovering life beyond our planet might mean for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For the “Electric Skin” fashion track, events spanned a range of topics revolving around the role that technology will play in the future of the field, including sold-out workshops where participants learned how to laser-cut and engineer “structural garments.” A panel looking at generative technologies explored how designers are using AI to spur innovation in their companies.&amp;nbsp;Onur Yüce Gün, director of computational design at New Balance, also spoke on a panel with Ziyuan “Zoey” Zhu from IDEO, MIT Media Lab research scientist and architect Behnaz Farahi, and Fiorenzo Omenetto, principal investigator and director of The Tufts Silk Lab and the Frank C. Doble Professor of Engineering at Tufts University and a professor in the Biomedical Engineering Department and in the Department of Physics at Tufts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Beyond the three themed tracks, the festival comprised an eclectic mix of interactive events and panels. Cambridge Public Library hosted a “&lt;a href="https://cambridgesciencefestival.org/festival-guide-2024/?_sf_s=slam"&gt;Science Story Slam&lt;/a&gt;” with high-school students from 10 different states competing for $5,000 in prize money. Entrants shared 5-minute-long stories about their adventures in STEM, with topics ranging from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridgeday.com/2024/10/01/student-storytellers-come-from-around-the-state-to-bring-science-to-life-and-life-to-science/"&gt;probability to “astro-agriculture.”&lt;/a&gt; Judges included several MIT faculty and staff, as well as &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; national correspondent Kate Zernike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Elsewhere, the MIT Museum’s Gorman moderated&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cambridgesciencefestival.org/democracyintheageofai-d9q/"&gt;a discussion on AI and democracy&lt;/a&gt; that included Audrey Tang, the former minister of digital affairs of Taiwan. The panelists explored how AI tools could combat the polarization of political discourse and increase participation in democratic processes, particularly for marginalized voices. Also in the MIT Museum, the McGovern Institute for Brain Research organized a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cambridgesciencefestival.org/decodingthebrain-ah6/"&gt;“Decoding the Brain”&lt;/a&gt; event with demos involving real animal brains, while the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard ran a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://bit.ly/3zfO33M"&gt;“Discovery After Dark”&lt;/a&gt; event to commemorate&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/celebrating-broads-20th-anniversary"&gt;the institute’s 20th anniversary&lt;/a&gt;. Sunday’s&amp;nbsp;Science Carnival featured more than 100 demos, events, and activities, including the ever-popular “Robot Petting Zoo.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When it first launched in 2007, the Cambridge Science Festival was by many accounts the first large-scale event of its kind across the entire United States. Similar festivals have since popped up all over the country, including&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.worldsciencefestival.com/"&gt;the World Science Festival&lt;/a&gt; in New York City,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://usasciencefestival.org/"&gt;the USA Science and Engineering Festival&lt;/a&gt; in Washington,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://ncsciencefestival.org/"&gt;the North Carolina Science Festival&lt;/a&gt; in Chapel Hill, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.lovestemsd.org/"&gt;the San Diego Festival of Science and Engineering&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;More information about the festival is available&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cambridgesciencefestival.org/"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;, including&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cambridgesciencefestival.org/volunteer/"&gt;opportunities to participate&lt;/a&gt; in next year’s events.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While it’s easy to be amazed by the constant drumbeat of innovations coming from Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, sometimes overlooked are the dedicated individuals working to make those scientific and technological breakthroughs a reality. Every day, people in the neighborhood tackle previously intractable problems and push the frontiers of their fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s Kendall Square Association (KSA) Annual Meeting centered around celebrating the people behind the area’s prolific innovation ecosystem. That included a new slate of awards and recognitions for community members and a panel discussion featuring MIT President Sally Kornbluth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s truly inspiring to be surrounded by all of you: people who seem to share an exuberant curiosity, a pervasive ethic of service, and the baseline expectation that we’re all interested in impact — in making a difference for people and the planet,” Kornbluth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gathering took place in MIT’s Walker Memorial (Building 50) on Memorial Drive and attracted entrepreneurs, life science workers, local students, restaurant and retail shop owners, and leaders of nonprofits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The KSA itself is a nonprofit organization made up of over 150 organizations across the greater Kendall Square region, from large companies to universities like MIT and Harvard, along with the independent shops and restaurants that give Kendall Square its distinct character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New to this year’s event were two Founder Awards, which were given to Sangeeta Bhatia, the the John and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, and Michal Preminger, head of Johnson and Johnson Innovation, for their work bringing people together to achieve hard things that benefit humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The KSA will donate $2,500 to the Science Club for Girls in Bhatia’s honor and $2,500 to Innovators for Purpose in honor of Preminger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognition was also given to Alex Cheung of the Cambridge Innovation Center and Shazia Mir of LabCentral for their work bringing Kendall Square’s community members together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cambridge Mayor Denise Simmons also spoke at the event, noting the vital role the Kendall Square community has played in things like Covid-19 vaccine development and in the fight against climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As many of you know, Cambridge has a long and proud history of innovation, with the presence of MIT and the remarkable growth of the tech and life science industry examples of that,” Simmons said. “We are leaving a lasting, positive impact in our city. This community has made and continues to make enormous contributions, not just to our city but to the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her talk, Kornbluth also introduced the Kendall Square community to her plans for The Climate Project at MIT, which is designed to focus the Institute’s talent and resources to achieve real-world impact on climate change faster. The project will provide funding and catalyze partnerships around six climate “missions,” or broad areas where MIT researchers will seek to identify gaps in the global climate response that MIT can help fill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Climate Project is a whole-of-MIT mobilization that’s mission driven, solution focused, and outward looking,” Kornbluth explained. “If you want to make progress, faster and at scale, that’s the way!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After mingling with Kendall community members, Kornbluth said she still considers herself a newbie to the area but is coming to see the success of Kendall Square and MIT as more than a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more time I spend here, the more I come to understand the incredible synergies between MIT and Kendall Square,” Kornbluth said. “We know, for example, that proximity is an essential ingredient in our collective and distinctive recipe for impact. That proximity, and the cross-fertilization that comes with it, helps us churn out new technologies and patents, found startups, and course-correct our work as we try to keep pace with the world’s challenges. We can’t do any of this separately. Our work together — all of us in this thriving, wildly entrepreneurial community — is what drives the success of our innovation ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inventive solutions to some of the world’s most critical problems are being discovered in labs, classrooms, and centers across MIT every day. Many of these solutions move from the lab to the commercial world with the help of over 85 Institute resources that comprise MIT’s robust innovation and entrepreneurship (I&amp;amp;E) ecosystem. The Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) draws on MIT’s wealth of I&amp;amp;E knowledge and experience to help researchers commercialize their breakthrough technologies through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://jwafs.mit.edu/SolutionsGrants"&gt;J-WAFS Solutions grant program&lt;/a&gt;. By collaborating with I&amp;amp;E programs on campus, J-WAFS prepares MIT researchers for the commercial world, where their novel innovations aim to improve productivity, accessibility, and sustainability of water and food systems, creating economic, environmental, and societal benefits along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The J-WAFS Solutions program launched in 2015 with support from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.communityjameel.org/"&gt;Community Jameel&lt;/a&gt;, an international organization that advances science and learning for communities to thrive. Since 2015, J-WAFS Solutions has supported 19 projects with one-year grants of up to $150,000, with some projects receiving renewal grants for a second year of support. Solutions projects all address challenges related to water or food. Modeled after the esteemed grant program of MIT’s Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation, and initially administered by Deshpande Center staff, the J-WAFS Solutions program follows a similar approach by supporting projects that have already completed the basic research and proof-of-concept phases.&amp;nbsp;With technologies that are one to three years away from commercialization, grantees work on identifying their potential markets and learn to focus on how their technology can meet the needs of future customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ingenuity thrives at MIT, driving inventions that can be translated into real-world applications for widespread adoption, implantation, and use,” says J-WAFS Director Professor John H. Lienhard V. “But successful commercialization of MIT technology requires engineers to focus on many challenges beyond making the technology work. MIT’s I&amp;amp;E network offers a variety of programs that help researchers develop technology readiness, investigate markets, conduct customer discovery, and initiate product design and development,” Lienhard adds.&amp;nbsp;“With this strong I&amp;amp;E framework, many J-WAFS Solutions teams have established startup companies by the completion of the grant.&amp;nbsp;J-WAFS-supported technologies have had powerful, positive effects on human welfare. Together, the J-WAFS Solutions program and MIT’s I&amp;amp;E ecosystem demonstrate how academic research can evolve into business innovations that make a better world,” Lienhard says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating I&amp;amp;E collaborations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to support for furthering research, J-WAFS Solutions grants allow faculty, students, postdocs, and research staff to learn the fundamentals of how to transform their work into commercial products and companies. As part of the grant requirements, researchers must interact with mentors through MIT Venture Mentoring Service (VMS). VMS connects MIT entrepreneurs with teams of carefully selected professionals who provide free and confidential mentorship, guidance, and other services to help advance ideas into for-profit, for-benefit, or nonprofit ventures. Since 2000, VMS has mentored over 4,600 MIT entrepreneurs across all industries, through a dynamic and accomplished group of nearly 200 mentors who volunteer their time so that others may succeed. The mentors provide impartial and unbiased advice to members of the MIT community, including MIT alumni in the Boston area. J-WAFS Solutions teams have been guided by 21 mentors from numerous companies and nonprofits. Mentors often attend project events and progress meetings throughout the grant period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Working with VMS has provided me and my organization with a valuable sounding board for a range of topics, big and small,” says Eric Verploegen PhD ’08, former research engineer in the MIT D-Lab and founder of J-WAFS spinout &lt;a href="https://www.coolveg.org/"&gt;CoolVeg&lt;/a&gt;. Along with professors Leon Glicksman and Daniel Frey, Verploegen received a J-WAFS Solutions grant in 2021 to commercialize cold-storage chambers that use evaporative cooling to help farmers preserve fruits and vegetables in rural off-grid communities. Verploegen started CoolVeg in 2022 to increase access and adoption of open-source, evaporative cooling technologies through collaborations with businesses, research institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and government agencies. “Working as a solo founder at my nonprofit venture, it is always great to have avenues to get feedback on communications approaches, overall strategy, and operational issues that my mentors have experience with,” Verploegen says. Three years after the initial Solutions grant, one of the VMS mentors assigned to the evaporative cooling team still acts as a mentor to Verploegen today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Solutions grant requirement is for teams to participate in the Spark program — a free, three-week course that provides an entry point for researchers to explore the potential value of their innovation. Spark is part of the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Innovation Corps (I-Corps), which is an “immersive, entrepreneurial training program that facilitates the transformation of invention to impact.” In 2018, MIT received an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-selected-ninth-nsf-innovation-corps-node-new-england-0904"&gt;award&lt;/a&gt; from the NSF, establishing the New England Regional Innovation Corps Node (NE I-Corps) to deliver I-Corps training to participants across New England. Trainings are open to researchers, engineers, scientists, and others who want to engage in a customer discovery process for their technology. Offered regularly throughout the year, the Spark course helps participants identify markets and explore customer needs in order to understand how their technologies can be positioned competitively in their target markets. They learn to assess barriers to adoption, as well as potential regulatory issues or other challenges to commercialization. NE-I-Corps reports that since its start, over 1,200 researchers from MIT have completed the program and have gone on to launch 175 ventures, raising over $3.3 billion in funding from grants and investors, and creating over 1,800 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constantinos Katsimpouras, a research scientist in the Department of Chemical Engineering, went through the NE I-Corps Spark program to better understand the customer base for a technology he developed with&amp;nbsp;professors Gregory Stephanopoulos and Anthony Sinskey.&amp;nbsp;The group received a J-WAFS Solutions grant in 2021&amp;nbsp;for their microbial platform that converts food waste from the dairy industry into valuable products.&amp;nbsp;“As a scientist with no prior experience in entrepreneurship, the program introduced me to important concepts and tools for conducting customer interviews and adopting a new mindset,” notes Katsimpouras. “Most importantly, it encouraged me to get out of the building and engage in interviews with potential customers and stakeholders, providing me with invaluable insights and a deeper understanding of my industry,” he adds. These interviews also helped connect the team with companies willing to provide resources to test and improve their technology — a critical step to the scale-up of any lab invention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Professor Cem Tasan’s research group in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, the I-Corps program led them to the J-WAFS Solutions grant, instead of the other way around. Tasan is currently working with postdoc Onur Guvenc on a J-WAFS Solutions project to manufacture formable sheet metal by consolidating steel scrap without melting, thereby reducing water use compared to traditional steel processing. Before applying for the Solutions grant, Guvenc took part in NE I-Corps. Like Katsimpouras, Guvenc benefited from the interaction with industry. “This program required me to step out of the lab and engage with potential customers, allowing me to learn about their immediate challenges and test my initial assumptions about the market,” Guvenc recalls. “My interviews with industry professionals also made me aware of the connection between water consumption and steelmaking processes, which ultimately led to the J-WAFS 2023 Solutions Grant,” says Guvenc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completing the Spark program, participants may be eligible to apply for the Fusion program, which provides microgrants of up to $1,500 to conduct further customer discovery. The Fusion program is self-paced, requiring teams to conduct 12 additional customer interviews and craft a final presentation summarizing their key learnings. Professor Patrick Doyle’s J-WAFS Solutions team completed the Spark and Fusion programs at MIT. Most recently, their team was accepted to join the NSF I-Corps National program with a $50,000 award. The intensive program requires teams to complete an additional 100 customer discovery interviews over seven weeks. Located in the Department of Chemical Engineering, the Doyle lab is working on a sustainable microparticle hydrogel system to rapidly remove micropollutants from water. The team’s focus has expanded to higher value purifications in amino acid and biopharmaceutical manufacturing applications. Devashish Gokhale PhD ’24 worked with Doyle on much of the underlying science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our platform technology could potentially be used for selective separations in very diverse market segments, ranging from individual consumers to large industries and government bodies with varied use-cases,” Gokhale explains. He goes on to say, “The I-Corps Spark program added significant value by providing me with an effective framework to approach this problem ... I was assigned a mentor who provided critical feedback, teaching me how to formulate effective questions and identify promising opportunities.” Gokhale says that by the end of Spark, the team was able to identify the best target markets for their products. He also says that the program provided valuable seminars on topics like intellectual property, which was helpful in subsequent discussions the team had with MIT’s Technology Licensing Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another member of Doyle’s team, Arjav Shah, a recent PhD from MIT’s Department of Chemical Engineering and a current MBA candidate at the MIT Sloan School of Management, is spearheading the team’s commercialization plans. Shah attended Fusion last fall and hopes to lead efforts to incorporate a startup company called hydroGel.&amp;nbsp; “I admire the hypothesis-driven approach of the I-Corps program,” says Shah. “It has enabled us to identify our customers’ biggest pain points, which will hopefully lead us to finding a product-market fit.” He adds “based on our learnings from the program, we have been able to pivot to impact-driven, higher-value applications in the food processing and biopharmaceutical industries.” Postdoc Luca Mazzaferro will lead the technical team at hydroGel alongside Shah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a different project, Qinmin Zheng, a postdoc in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, is working with Professor Andrew Whittle and Lecturer Fábio Duarte. Zheng plans to take the Fusion course this fall to advance their J-WAFS Solutions project that aims to commercialize a novel sensor to quantify the relative abundance of major algal species and provide early detection of harmful algal blooms. After completing Spark, Zheng says he’s “excited to participate in the Fusion program, and potentially the National I-Corps program, to further explore market opportunities and minimize risks in our future product development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic and societal benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercializing technologies developed at MIT is one of the ways J-WAFS helps ensure that MIT research advances will have real-world impacts in water and food systems. Since its inception, the J-WAFS Solutions program has awarded 28 grants (including renewals), which have supported 19 projects that address a wide range of global water and food challenges. The program has distributed over $4 million to 24 professors, 11 research staff, 15 postdocs, and 30 students across MIT. Nearly half of all J-WAFS Solutions projects have resulted in spinout companies or commercialized products, including eight companies to date plus two open-source technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nona-technologies.com/"&gt;Nona Technologies&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a J-WAFS spinout that is helping the world by developing new approaches to produce freshwater for drinking. Desalination — the process of removing salts from seawater — typically requires a large-scale technology called reverse osmosis. But Nona created a desalination device that can work in remote off-grid locations.&amp;nbsp;By separating salt and bacteria from water using electric current through a process called ion concentration polarization (ICP), their technology also reduces overall energy consumption. The novel method was developed by Jongyoon Han, professor of electrical engineering and biological engineering, and research scientist Junghyo Yoon. Along with Bruce Crawford, a Sloan MBA alum, Han and Yoon created Nona Technologies to bring their lightweight, energy-efficient desalination technology to the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My feeling early on was that once you have technology, commercialization will take care of itself,” admits Crawford. The team completed both the Spark and Fusion programs and quickly realized that much more work would be required. “Even in our first 24 interviews, we learned that the two first markets we envisioned would not be viable in the near term, and we also got our first hints at the beachhead we ultimately selected,” says Crawford. Nona Technologies has since won MIT’s $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, received media attention from outlets like &lt;em&gt;Newsweek &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;, and hired a team that continues to further the technology for deployment in resource-limited areas where clean drinking water may be scarce.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food-borne diseases sicken millions of people worldwide each year, but J-WAFS researchers are addressing this issue by integrating molecular engineering, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence to revolutionize food pathogen testing. Professors Tim Swager and Alexander Klibanov, of the Department of Chemistry, were awarded one of the first J-WAFS Solutions grants for their sensor that targets food safety pathogens. The sensor uses specialized droplets that behave like a dynamic lens, changing in the presence of target bacteria in order to detect dangerous bacterial contamination in food. In 2018, Swager launched &lt;a href="https://www.xibus.systems/"&gt;Xibus Systems Inc.&lt;/a&gt; to bring the sensor to market and advance food safety for greater public health, sustainability, and economic security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our involvement with the J-WAFS Solutions Program has been vital,” says Swager. “It has provided us with a bridge between the academic world and the business world and allowed us to perform more detailed work to create a usable application,” he adds. In 2022, Xibus developed a product called XiSafe, which enables the detection of contaminants like salmonella and listeria faster and with higher sensitivity than other food testing products. The innovation could save food processors billions of dollars worldwide and prevent thousands of food-borne fatalities annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS Solutions companies have raised nearly $66 million in venture capital and other funding. Just this past June, J-WAFS spinout SiTration announced that it raised an $11.8 million seed round. Jeffrey Grossman, a professor in MIT’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering, was another early J-WAFS Solutions grantee for his work on low-cost energy-efficient filters for desalination. The project enabled the development of nanoporous membranes and resulted in two spinout companies, &lt;a href="https://viaseparations.com/"&gt;Via Separations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://sitration.com/"&gt;SiTration&lt;/a&gt;. SiTration was co-founded by Brendan Smith PhD ’18, who was a part of the original J-WAFS team. Smith is CEO of the company and has overseen the advancement of the membrane technology, which has gone on to reduce cost and resource consumption in industrial wastewater treatment, advanced manufacturing, and resource extraction of materials such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel from recycled electric vehicle batteries. The company also recently announced that it is working with the mining company Rio Tinto to handle harmful wastewater generated at mines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's not just J-WAFS spinout companies that are producing real-world results. Products like the ECC Vial — a portable, low-cost method for &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; detection in water — have been brought to the market and helped thousands of people. The test kit was developed by MIT D-Lab Lecturer Susan Murcott and Professor Jeffrey Ravel of the MIT History Section. The duo received a J-WAFS Solutions grant in 2018 to promote safely managed drinking water and improved public health in Nepal, where it is difficult to identify which wells are contaminated by &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. By the end of their grant period, the team had manufactured approximately 3,200 units, of which 2,350 were distributed — enough to help 12,000 people in Nepal. The researchers also trained local Nepalese on best manufacturing practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very important, in my life experience, to follow your dream and to serve others,” says Murcott. Economic success is important to the health of any venture, whether it’s a company or a product, but equally important is the social impact — a philosophy that J-WAFS research strives to uphold. “Do something because it’s worth doing and because it changes people’s lives and saves lives,” Murcott adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As J-WAFS prepares to celebrate its 10th anniversary this year, we look forward to continued collaboration with MIT’s many I&amp;amp;E programs to advance knowledge and develop solutions that will have tangible effects on the world’s water and food systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn more about the &lt;a href="https://jwafs.mit.edu/SolutionsGrants"&gt;J-WAFS Solutions program&lt;/a&gt; and about &lt;a href="https://facts.mit.edu/entrepreneurship-innovation/"&gt;innovation and entrepreneurship at MIT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They planned to fly for four years and to get as far as Jupiter and Saturn. But nearly half a century and 15 billion miles later, NASA’s twin Voyager spacecraft have far exceeded their original mission, winging past the outer planets and busting out of our heliosphere, beyond the influence of the sun. The probes are currently making their way through interstellar space, traveling farther than any human-made object.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Along their improbable journey, the Voyagers made first-of-their-kind observations at all four giant outer planets and their moons using only a handful of instruments, including MIT’s Plasma Science Experiments — identical plasma sensors that were designed and built in the 1970s in Building 37 by MIT scientists and engineers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Plasma Science Experiment (also known as the Plasma Spectrometer, or PLS for short) measured charged particles in planetary magnetospheres, the solar wind, and the interstellar medium, the material between stars. Since launching on the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1977, the PLS has revealed new phenomena near all the outer planets and in the solar wind across the solar system. The experiment played a crucial role in confirming the moment when Voyager 2 crossed the heliosphere and moved outside of the sun’s regime, into interstellar space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now, to conserve the little power left on Voyager 2 and prolong the mission’s life, the Voyager scientists and engineers have made the decision to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-turns-off-science-instrument-to-save-voyager-2-power/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;shut off MIT’s Plasma Science Experiment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. It’s the first in a line of science instruments that will progressively blink off over the coming years. On Sept. 26, the Voyager 2 PLS sent its last communication from 12.7 billion miles away, before it received the command to shut down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; spoke with John Belcher, the Class of 1922 Professor of Physics at MIT, who was a member of the original team that designed and built the plasma spectrometers, and John Richardson, principal research scientist at MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, who is the experiment’s principal investigator. Both Belcher and Richardson offered their reflections on the retirement of this interstellar piece of MIT history.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Looking back at the experiment’s contributions, what are the greatest hits, in terms of what MIT’s Plasma Spectrometer has revealed about the solar system and interstellar space?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richardson:&lt;/strong&gt; A key PLS finding at Jupiter was the discovery of the Io torus, a plasma donut surrounding Jupiter, formed from sulphur and oxygen from Io’s volcanos (which were discovered in Voyager images). At Saturn, PLS found a magnetosphere full of water and oxygen that had been knocked off of Saturn’s icy moons. At Uranus and Neptune, the tilt of the magnetic fields led to PLS seeing smaller density features, with Uranus’ plasma disappearing near the planet. Another key PLS observation was of the termination shock, which was the first observation of the plasma at the largest shock in the solar system, where the solar wind stopped being supersonic. This boundary had a huge drop in speed and an increase in the density and temperature of the solar wind. And finally, PLS documented Voyager 2’s crossing of the heliopause by detecting a stopping of outward-flowing plasma. This signaled the end of the solar wind and the beginning of the local interstellar medium (LISM). Although not designed to measure the LISM, PLS constantly measured the interstellar plasma currents beyond the heliosphere. It is very sad to lose this instrument and data!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belcher:&lt;/strong&gt; It is important to emphasize that PLS was the result of decades of development by MIT Professor Herbert Bridge (1919-1995) and Alan Lazarus (1931-2014). The first version of the instrument they designed was flown on Explorer 10 in 1961. And the most recent version is flying on the Solar Probe, which is collecting measurements very close to the sun to understand the origins of solar wind. Bridge was the principal investigator for plasma probes on spacecraft which visited the sun and every major planetary body in the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;During their tenure aboard the Voyager probes, how did the plasma sensors do their job over the last 47 years?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richardson:&lt;/strong&gt; There were four Faraday cup detectors designed by Herb Bridge that measured currents from ions and electrons that entered the detectors. By measuring these particles at different energies, we could find the plasma velocity, density, and temperature in the solar wind and in the four planetary magnetospheres Voyager encountered. Voyager data were (and are still) sent to Earth every day and received by NASA’s deep space network of antennae. Keeping two 1970s-era spacecraft going for 47 years and counting has been an amazing feat of JPL engineering prowess — you can google the most recent rescue when Voyager 1 lost some memory in November of 2023 and stopped sending data. JPL figured out the problem and was able to reprogram the flight data system from 15 billion miles away, and all is back to normal now. Shutting down PLS involves sending a command which will get to Voyager 2 about 19 hours later, providing the rest of the spacecraft enough power to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Once the plasma sensors have shut down, how much more could Voyager do, and how far might it still go?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richardson:&lt;/strong&gt; Voyager will still measure the galactic cosmic rays, magnetic fields, and plasma waves. The available power decreases about 4 watts per year as the plutonium which powers them decays. We hope to keep some of the instruments running until the mid-2030s, but that will be a challenge as power levels decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belcher:&lt;/strong&gt; Nick Oberg at the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute in the Netherlands has made an exhaustive study of the future of the spacecraft, using data from the European Space Agency’s spacecraft&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.space.com/41312-gaia-mission.html" target="_blank"&gt;Gaia&lt;/a&gt;. In about 30,000 years, the spacecraft will reach the distance to the nearest stars. Because space is so vast, there is zero chance that the spacecraft will collide directly with a star in the lifetime of the universe. However, the spacecraft surface will erode by microcollisions with vast clouds of interstellar dust, but this happens very slowly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Oberg’s estimate, the Golden Records [identical records that were placed aboard each probe, that contain selected sounds and images to represent life on Earth] are likely to survive for a span of over 5 billion years. After those 5 billion years, things are difficult to predict, since at this point, the Milky Way will collide with its massive neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy. During this collision, there is a one in five chance that the spacecraft will be flung into the intergalactic medium, where there is little dust and little weathering. In that case, it is possible that the spacecraft will survive for trillions of years. A trillion years is about 100 times the current age of the universe. The Earth ceases to exist in about 6 billion years, when the sun enters its red giant phase and engulfs it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a “poor man’s” version of the Golden Record, Robert Butler, the chief engineer of the Plasma Instrument, inscribed the names of the MIT engineers and scientists who had worked on the spacecraft on the collector plate of the side-looking cup. Butler’s home state was New Hampshire, and he put the state motto, “Live Free or Die,” at the top of the list of names.

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A new, multidisciplinary MIT&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://musictech.mit.edu/mtcgp"&gt;graduate program in music technology and computation&lt;/a&gt; will feature faculty, labs, and curricula from across the Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The program is a collaboration between the &lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Music and Theater Arts Section&lt;/a&gt; in the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (SHASS) and the &lt;a href="https://engineering.mit.edu" target="_blank"&gt;School of Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. Faculty for the program share appointments between the Music and Theater Arts Section, the &lt;a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu" target="_blank"&gt;Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science&lt;/a&gt; (EECS), and the &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu"&gt;MIT Schwarzman College of Computing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The launch of a new graduate program in music technology strikes me as both a necessary and a&amp;nbsp;provocative gesture — an important leap in an era being rapidly redefined by exponential growth in computation, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interactions of every conceivable kind,”&amp;nbsp;says&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/person/jay-scheib" target="_blank"&gt;Jay Scheib&lt;/a&gt;,​​ head of the MIT Music and Theater Arts Section and the Class of 1949 Professor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Music plays an elegant role at the fore of a remarkable convergence of art and technology,” adds Scheib. “It’s the right time to launch this program and if not at MIT, then where?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT’s practitioners define music technology as the field of scientific inquiry where they study, discover, and develop new computational approaches to music that include music information retrieval; artificial intelligence; machine learning; generative algorithms; interaction and performance systems; digital instrument design; conceptual and perceptual modeling of music; acoustics; audio signal processing; and software development for creative expression and music applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/person/eran-egozy" target="_blank"&gt;Eran Egozy&lt;/a&gt;, professor of the practice in music technology and one of the program leads, says MIT’s focus is technical research in music technology that always centers the humanistic and artistic aspects of making music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There are so many MIT students who are fabulous musicians,” says Egozy. “We'll approach music technology as computer scientists, mathematicians, and musicians.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With the launch of this new program — an offering alongside those available in MIT’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/research/?filter=everything&amp;amp;tag=music"&gt;Media Lab&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere — Egozy sees MIT becoming the obvious destination for students interested in music and computation study, preparing high-impact graduates for roles in academia and industry, while also helping mold creative, big-picture thinkers who can tackle large challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigating big ideas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The program will encompass two master’s degrees and a PhD:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;The Master of Science (MS) is a two-semester, thesis-based program available only to MIT undergraduates. One semester of fellowship is automatically awarded to all admitted students. The first class will enroll in fall 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;The Master of Applied Science (MAS) is a two-semester, coursework-based program available to all students. One semester of fellowship funding is automatically awarded to all admitted students. Applications for this program will open in fall 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;The PhD program is available to all students, who would apply to MIT’s School of Engineering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/person/anna-huang" target="_blank"&gt;Anna Huang&lt;/a&gt;, a new MIT assistant professor who holds a shared faculty position between the MIT Music and Theater Arts Section and the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, is collaborating with Egozy to develop and launch the program. Huang arrived at MIT this fall after spending eight years with Magenta at Google Brain and DeepMind, spearheading efforts in generative modeling, reinforcement learning, and human-computer interaction to support human-AI partnerships in music-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“As a composer turned AI researcher who specializes in generative music technology, my long-term goal is to develop AI systems that can shed new light on how we understand, learn, and create music, and to learn from interactions between musicians in order to transform how we approach human-AI collaboration,” says Huang. “This new program will let us further investigate how musical applications can illuminate problems in understanding neural networks, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT’s new &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/3-questions-keeril-makan-new-mit-music-building-0109"&gt;Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building&lt;/a&gt;, featuring&amp;nbsp;enhanced music technology spaces, will also help transform music education with versatile performance venues and optimized rehearsal facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A natural home for music technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT’s world-class, top-ranked engineering program, combined with its focus on computation and its conservatory-level music education offerings, makes the Institute a natural home for the continued expansion of music technology education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The collaborative nature of the new program is the latest example of interdisciplinary work happening across the Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I am thrilled that the School of Engineering is partnering with the MIT Music and Theater Arts Section on this important initiative, which represents the convergence of various engineering areas — such as AI and design — with music,” says &lt;a href="https://engineering.mit.edu/about/leadership/anantha-p-chandrakasan/" target="_blank"&gt;Anantha Chandrakasan&lt;/a&gt;, dean of the School of Engineering, chief innovation and strategy officer, and the Vannevar Bush Professor of EECS. “I can’t wait to see the innovative projects the students will create and how they will drive this new field forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Everyone on campus knows that MIT is a great place to do music. But I want people to come to MIT because of what we do in music,” says &lt;a href="https://philosophy.mit.edu/rayo/" target="_blank"&gt;Agustin Rayo&lt;/a&gt;, the Kenan Sahin Dean of SHASS. “This outstanding collaboration with the Schwarzman College of Computing and the School of Engineering will make that dream a reality, by bringing together the world’s best engineers with our extraordinary musicians to create the next generation of music technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The new master’s program offers students an unparalleled opportunity to explore the intersection of music and technology,” says &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/daniel-huttenlocher/" target="_blank"&gt;Daniel Huttenlocher&lt;/a&gt;, dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and the Henry Ellis Warren Professor of EECS. “It equips them with a deep understanding of this confluence, preparing them to advance new approaches to computational models of music and be at the forefront of an evolving area.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Jason Sparapani | Department of Materials Science and Engineering</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Meanwell carefully placed a pottery sherd — or broken fragment of ceramic — under the circular, diamond-coated blade of a benchtop saw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cutting the sample is the first big step,” says Meanwell, a lecturer in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT. She was leading a lab in making thin sections of pottery for petrographic analysis, a method used to examine ceramics and determine their composition, structure, and origins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You want a slice that’s thin enough to work with but thick enough to maintain its structure through the rest of the process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lab was part of a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cmrae.mit.edu/education/summer/"&gt;summer intensive course&lt;/a&gt; at MIT for PhD students and early-career researchers in ceramic petrography, a specialized skill in archaeology. The course focuses on using optical microscopy to characterize pottery from ancient civilizations, revealing information about manufacturing techniques and provenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve students from North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia participated in the three-week course in June to develop advanced skills, enriching students’ understanding of ancient ceramics and their broader historical and cultural contexts. It included morning seminars in mineralogy and archaeological theory and hands-on laboratories to identify and characterize materials, understand how they were manufactured, and infer what they&amp;nbsp;were&amp;nbsp;most likely used for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwell and Senior Technical Instructor William Gilstrap taught the group how to examine pottery samples collected from around the world — Greece, Mexico, and the Middle East — using polarized light microscopes to examine the materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Polarized light will transmit through a mineral at 30 microns in a predictable manner — it interacts with its structure, and the optical properties help us identify which mineral types they are,” says Gilstrap. By determining the minerals, researchers can link them to the geological landscape they came from. “This helps us know more about how people interacted with their environments, and perhaps, how people transferred knowledge on time and space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hands-on training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course builds on the two-semester-long class Materials in Ancient Societies, run by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cmrae.mit.edu/"&gt;Center for Materials Research in Archaeology and Ethnology&lt;/a&gt; (CMRAE), a consortium of eight Boston-area schools that provides training in archaeological and ethnographic materials. Few institutions globally teach ceramic petrography, and most provide short, one- to two-week courses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gilstrap highlighted the need for extended training. “It takes time to develop the skills to find the nuances in the structure as well as to learn mineralogy, geology, and the manufacturing techniques of ceramics,” Gilstrap says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students learn to reconstruct the production methods of past ceramics, from cooking pots to roof tiles, by examining the underlying structure of materials to determine how they were made. For example, they can identify whether a vessel was crafted by pinching, a technique in which a potter presses into a ball of clay to form indentations, or coiling, which involves stacking rope-like strands of clay to build up the vessel’s walls. This analysis can reveal production, transport, and consumption patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can see where things are made. We can see where things ended up and direction of exchange. And that’s the basics of an economy,” says Gilstrap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course blends sciences and humanities, covering basic chemistry, geology, and anthropological theory. Students also learn how to make their own petrographic thin sections — slices of pottery impregnated in epoxy and mounted on glass slides.&amp;nbsp;These sections are essential for microscopic analysis of the ceramic’s composition and structure. Most researchers, however, typically do not make their own thin sections. Instead, they send their samples to specialized labs, where the preparation process costs approximately $45 per sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you have 300 samples, that gets costly,” Gilstrap adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applying new skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This practical experience resonated with Jean Paul Rojas and Michelle Young, from Vanderbilt University’s anthropology department. As did all the students, they brought in their own slides for analysis. Theirs were made by a colleague two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These have never been petrographically analyzed, so it would be the first time looking at them and trying to identify the petro groups,” says Rojas, a PhD student in archaeology. His research focuses on human migration, exchange, and movement in the Caribbean, particularly the&amp;nbsp;mineralogical origins of ceramics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the MIT summer course, Rojas had little training in geology or mineralogy. Two weeks in, he joked, “I know what rocks are now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now I feel like I know how to really look at all these different minerals, the feldspars and the quartz and the plagioclase — the different types of feldspars — the micas, and I can identify them and make something useful out of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young is an assistant professor in Vanderbilt’s anthropology department and Rojas’ thesis advisor. She’s always had an interest in materials science and ceramics, and she’s collaborated with a petrographer in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But in order to truly understand the data, I needed an introduction into the technique,” Young says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she returns to Vanderbilt, she plans on including petrography as one of the techniques&amp;nbsp;featured in a lab sciences course for non-science majors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am hoping at some point that I will eventually publish on petrographic results, or at least use the technique as a very preliminary way of grouping different ceramics,” Young says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another summer course student, Anna Pineda, a PhD candidate from the Philippines studying at the Australian National University, is analyzing jar burial sites in the islands and archipelagos between Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean. She’s particularly interested in understanding how mineral analysis techniques in geology can inform archaeology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I talk to geologists, they can’t really get what I want to do unless they have an archeological background,” Pineda said. “It’s good to have a perspective from people who do archaeology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pineda plans to incorporate knowledge gained from the course into her PhD research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully, I can get better results out of research on materials that have never been studied yet, using methods that aren’t commonly applied, in Island Southeast Asia.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <description><![CDATA[PhD student Mariel García-Montes researches the internet’s far-reaching impact on society, especially regarding privacy and young people.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Austin Chen | MIT News correspondent</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After the Arab Spring and the Occupy movement, a single Tweet or Facebook post was able to mobilize thousands in a matter of hours. In 2012, protests came to the streets of Mexico as young people demonstrated against the results of the general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent college graduate of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mariel García-Montes had classmates who were nonviolently participating in the protests. One was arrested and jailed, and as García-Montes pored over online surveillance videos and photos to help free her, she was struck by the power of the tools at her disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Videos and maps and photographs placed her at a different location at the time that her arraignment said,” García-Montes says. “When she was able to walk out of jail partly because of technological evidence, I thought, ‘Maybe this is a window of opportunity to use technology for social good.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over a decade later, García-Montes is still looking for more of those windows. She first came to MIT in 2016 to pursue a master’s degree in comparative media studies and is currently working with Professor Eden Medina on a&amp;nbsp;PhD thesis in the Program in Science, Technology, and Society, which will chart the history of technology’s influence on surveillance and privacy, particularly in her home country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would love for my work, theoretical and practical, to build into these global movements for necessary and proportionate surveillance,” she says. “It needs to have counterweights and limits, and it needs to be really thought through to preserve people’s privacy and other rights, not just security.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More broadly,” she continues, “I would love to be part of a generation thinking about what technology would look like if we put the public interest first.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing up alongside the internet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;García-Montes has been thinking about justice and the public for much of her life, thanks in large part to her mother, who taught philosophy at the university level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She was the ultimate professor for me,” she says. “She provided me with a moral compass and intellectual curiosity, and I’m grateful I get to live her dreams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her mother was also instrumental in piquing her interest in the internet. As a professor, she had access to the internet at a time when few Mexicans did, and set García-Montes up with an email account and allowed her to use the computer at the university when she was a child.&amp;nbsp;The experience was formative, as she noticed the “vast difference” between those who had access and those who did not. For example, she recalls learning online about a devastating tsunami in Asia, while none of her peers had any idea that it was happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As time passed and more and more people did gain internet access, the online landscape changed, particularly for young people. García-Montes quickly realized that someone needed to take responsibility for keeping those young people safe and internet-literate, and she worked with a number of organizations that did just that, such as UNICEF and Global Changemakers. The issues have only compounded since then, but she isn’t letting up either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no silver bullet,” she says. “We need to rethink the entire ecosystem. We cannot put it on parents to teach their kids. We cannot put it on teachers. We cannot put it on online users. Instead of only centering profit and only centering page views or engagement, we need to also center pro-social behavior and the public interest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raised by women — her mom, her aunt, her cousin, and her grandmother —&amp;nbsp;García-Montes&amp;nbsp;incorporates the feminist ideals of her upbringing into her academic work&amp;nbsp;wherever she can. In 2022, she helped write a paper with MIT associate professor of urban science and planning Catherine D’Ignazio that examined the ways activists around the world are trying to address the deficiencies in government data on gender-related violence against women. The data are often absent or incomplete, so she and her co-authors highlighted the vital work being done to fill in the gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“​​When Catherine started to work with feminicide data activists, I knew a bunch of them because I had worked with them previously,” she says. “I thought, ‘Oh, my goodness, the day has finally come that these people can have the prominence that they’ve long deserved.’ The hours of work that they put in and the emotional toll it takes on them is just outstanding, and they weren’t really getting the recognition for that labor and their technical expertise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her dissertation is a study of the history of surveillance technologies in Mexico. Specifically, she is looking at the ways contemporary debates on information technologies, such as spyware and facial recognition, interact with existing governance and infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future of privacy and community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her thesis research has instilled in García-Montes a deep concern for where things are headed for the average citizen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Different types of data collection continue to be developed because of the data broker industry,” she says. “Your power bill can be an instrument of surveillance, and facial recognition has been appearing in airports. The forms of data collection are becoming much more nuanced, much more pervasive, and much harder to evade.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pervasiveness has led to a general acceptance among the population, she says, but she’s also encouraged by the advocacy groups that have continued to fight on. She agrees with those groups that it should not be left to individuals to protect their own data, and that ultimately, there needs to be a legislative and cultural environment that values the preservation of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The awareness of fights that have been won is rising,” she says.&amp;nbsp;“The awareness of the loss of privacy is also rising, and so I don’t think that it’s going to be a clear win for privacy-violating companies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While her studies at MIT fill most of her time, García-Montes also finds purpose participating in community life in her Greater-Boston neighborhood. During the coronavirus pandemic, García-Montes and her neighbors forged bonds as they provided mutual aid for the essential workers and vulnerable people of their neighborhood. The camaraderie they developed persists today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether online or in real life, “There is joy in community,” she says. “At the root of it, I want to be around people. I want to know my neighbors, and&amp;nbsp;being able to use technology to solve some of our mutual aid needs&amp;nbsp;helps me feel good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was 1978, over a decade before the word “sustainable” would infiltrate environmental nomenclature, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.mit.edu/rprinn/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ronald Prinn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, MIT professor of atmospheric science, had just founded the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://agage.mit.edu/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AGAGE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;). Today, AGAGE provides real-time measurements for well over 50 environmentally harmful trace gases, enabling us to determine emissions at the country level, a key element in verifying national adherence to the Montreal Protocol and the Paris Accord. This, Prinn says, started him thinking about doing science that informed decision making.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Much like global interest in sustainability, Prinn’s interest and involvement continued to grow into what would become three decades worth of achievements in sustainability science. The Center for Global Change Science (CGCS) and Joint Program on the Science and Policy Global Change, respectively founded and co-founded by Prinn, have recently joined forces to create the MIT School of Science’s new Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy (CS3), led by former CGCS postdoc turned MIT professor,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://idss.mit.edu/staff/noelle-selin/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Noelle Selin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;As he prepares to pass the torch, Prinn reflects on how far sustainability has come, and where it all began.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Tell us about the motivation for the MIT centers you helped to found around sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; In 1990 after I founded the Center for Global Change Science, I also co-founded the Joint Program on the Science and Policy Global Change with a very important partner, [Henry] “Jake” Jacoby. He’s now retired, but at that point he was a professor in the MIT Sloan School of Management. Together, we determined that in order to answer questions related to what we now call sustainability of human activities, you need to combine the natural and social sciences involved in these processes. Based on this, we decided to make a joint program between the CGCS and a center that he directed, the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research (CEEPR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It was called the “joint program” and was joint for two reasons — not only were two centers joining, but two disciplines were joining. It was not about simply doing the same science. It was about bringing a team of people together that could tackle these coupled issues of environment, human development and economy. We were the first group in the world to fully integrate these elements together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What has been your most impactful contribution and what effect did it have on the greater public’s overall understanding?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Our biggest contribution is the development, and more importantly, the application of the Integrated Global System Modeling [IGSM] framework, looking at human development in both developing countries and developed countries that had a significant impact on the way people thought about climate issues. With IGSM, we were able to look at the interactions among human and natural components, studying the feedbacks and impacts that climate change had on human systems; like how it would alter agriculture and other land activities, how it would alter things we derive from the ocean, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Policies were being developed largely by economists or climate scientists working independently, and we started showing how the real answers and analysis required a coupling of all of these components. We showed, and I think convincingly, that what people used to study independently, must be coupled together, because the impacts of climate change and air pollution affected so many things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To address the value of policy, despite the uncertainty in climate projections, we ran multiple runs of the IGSM with and without policy, with different choices for uncertain IGSM variables. For public communication, around 2005, we introduced our signature&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://globalchange.mit.edu/research/research-tools/risk-analysis/greenhouse-gamble"&gt;Greenhouse Gamble&lt;/a&gt; interactive visualization tools; these have been renewed over time as science and policies evolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What can MIT provide now at this critical juncture in understanding climate change and its impact?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;We need to further push the boundaries of integrated global system modeling to ensure full sustainability of human activity and all of its beneficial dimensions, which is the exciting focus that the CS3 is designed to address. We need to focus on sustainability as a central core element and use it to not just analyze existing policies but to propose new ones. Sustainability is not just climate or air pollution, it's got to do with human impacts in general. Human health is central to sustainability, and equally important to equity. We need to expand the capability for credibly assessing what the impact policies have not just on developed countries, but on developing countries, taking into account that many places around the world are at artisanal levels of their economies.&amp;nbsp;They cannot be blamed for anything that is changing climate and causing air pollution and other detrimental things that are currently going on. They need our help. That's what sustainability is in its full dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Our capabilities are evolving toward a modeling system so detailed that we can find out detrimental things about policies even at local levels before investing in changing infrastructure. This is going to require collaboration among even more disciplines and creating a seamless connection between research and decision making; not just for policies enacted in the public sector, but also for decisions that are made in the private sector.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In 2024, eight faculty were granted tenure in the MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. They include the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://sts-program.mit.edu/people/sts-faculty/dwai-banerjee/"&gt;Dwaipayan Banerjee&lt;/a&gt; is an associate professor in the Program in Science, Technology, and Society. His work foregrounds the intellectual labor of South Asian scientists, engineers and medical practitioners, challenging conventional understandings of science, technology, and medicine. Banerjee has published two books, “Enduring Cancer” and “Hematologies,” with a third, “Computing in the Time of Decolonization,” under review at Princeton University Press. His research spans the politics of health, pandemics, and computing, all through a lens that critically examines global inequalities in scientific and technological practice. Drawing upon his research, Banerjee's teaching philosophy emphasizes global perspectives and interdisciplinary inquiry, with courses like STS.012&amp;nbsp;(Science in Action) and 21A.504J/STS.086J/WGS.276J (Cultures of Computing) being highly popular at MIT. He has also played a pivotal role in various editorial boards, MIT committees, and advising PhD students, further solidifying his impact on both the academic and global community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://philosophy.mit.edu/people/faculty/dorst/"&gt;Kevin Dorst&lt;/a&gt; PhD ‘19 is an associate professor in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy. He works at the border between philosophy and the behavioral sciences, combining mathematical, computational, and empirical methods to study the causes of bias and polarization — and argues that people are more rational than you’d think. He earned his PhD from MIT in 2019, and then was a junior research fellow at Magdalen College at Oxford University and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, before returning to MIT in 2022.&amp;nbsp;He currently holds a visiting Humboldt Research Fellowship at the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cmsw.mit.edu/profile/paloma-duong/"&gt;Paloma Duong &lt;/a&gt;is an associate professor in MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing. At the intersection of cultural studies, media theory, and critical theory, she researches and teaches modern and contemporary Latin American culture. She works with social texts and emergent media cultures that speak to the exercise of cultural agencies and the formation of political subjectivity. Her most recent book is “Portable Postsocialisms: Cuban Mediascapes after the End of History,” a study of Cuba’s changing mediascape and an inquiry on the postsocialist condition and its contexts. Her articles have been published in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Latin American Cultural Studies&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Art Margins&lt;/em&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Cuban Counterpoints: Public Scholarship about a Changing Cuba&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://anthropology.mit.edu/people/faculty/amy-moran-thomas"&gt;Amy Moran-Thomas&lt;/a&gt; is an associate professor in MIT Anthropology. Her ethnographic research focuses on how health technologies and ecologies are designed and come to be materially embodied — often inequitably — by people in their ordinary lives. She received her PhD in Anthropology from Princeton University in 2012. Her first book, “Traveling with Sugar: Chronicles of a Global Epidemic (University of California Press, 2019),” offers an anthropological account of diabetes care technologies in use and the lives they shape in global perspective. The book received an award from the caregivers in Belize whose work it describes, alongside others. In 2024-26, she is co-leading a climate and health humanities project funded by an ACLS Digital Seed Grant, “Sugar Atlas: Counter-Mapping Diabetes from the Caribbean,” together with co-PIs Tonya Haynes and Nicole Charles. Also working on a book about embodied histories of energy, Moran-Thomas is interested in how social perspectives on design can contribute to producing fairer health technologies. More broadly, her research explores the material culture of chronic conditions; embodied aspects of planetary health; intergenerational dilemmas of responsibility; and writing public anthropology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cmsw.mit.edu/profile/justin-reich/"&gt;Justin Reich&lt;/a&gt; is an associate professor in MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing. He is an educational researcher interested in the future of learning in a networked world. He is the director of the MIT Teaching Systems Lab, which aspires to design, implement and research the future of teacher learning. He is the author of “Iterate: The Secret to Innovation in Schools” and “Failure to Disrupt: Why Technology Alone Can't Transform Education” from Harvard University Press. He is the host of the TeachLab podcast, and five open online courses on EdX including 0.504x (Sorting Truth from Fiction: Civic Online Reasoning) and 0.503x (Becoming a More Equitable Educator: Mindsets and Practices). He is a former fellow and faculty associate of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://anthropology.mit.edu/people/faculty/bettina-stoetzer"&gt;Bettina Stoetzer&lt;/a&gt; is an associate professor in MIT Anthropology. She is a cultural anthropologist whose research focuses on the intersections of ecology, globalization, and social justice in Europe and the U.S. Bettina’s award-winning book, “Ruderal City: Ecologies of Migration, Race, and Urban Nature in Berlin&amp;nbsp;(Duke University Press, 2022),” draws on fieldwork with immigrant and refugee communities, as well as ecologists, nature enthusiasts and other Berlin residents to illustrate how human-environment relations become a key register through which urban citizenship is articulated in Europe. She is also the author of a 2004 book on feminism and anti-racism, "InDifferenzen: Feministische Theorie in der Antirassistischen Kritik" (“InDifferences: Feminist Theory in Antiracist Criticism,&amp;nbsp;argument"). She co-edited “Shock and Awe: War on Words” with Bregje van Eekelen, Jennifer Gonzalez, and Anna Tsing&amp;nbsp;(New Pacific Press, 2004). She is currently working on a new project on wildlife mobility, climate change, and border politics in the U.S. and Germany. At MIT, she teaches classes on cities, race and migration, environmental justice, gender, and climate change. She received her MA in sociology, anthropology and media studies from the University of Goettingen and completed her PhD in anthropology at the University of California at Santa Cruz in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/ariel-white"&gt;Ariel White&lt;/a&gt; is an associate professor in the Department of Political Science. She studies voting and voting rights, race, the criminal legal system, and bureaucratic behavior. Her research uses large datasets to measure individual-level experiences, and to shed light on people's everyday interactions with government. Her recent work investigates how potential voters react to experiences with punitive government policies, such as incarceration and immigration enforcement, and how people can make their way back into political life after these experiences. In other projects, she and her co-authors have examined how local election officials treat constituents of different ethnicities, how media shapes public conversations, and whether parties face electoral penalties when nominating minority candidates. Her research has appeared in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;American Political Science Review&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Politics&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/bernardo-zacka"&gt;Bernardo Zacka&lt;/a&gt; is an associate professor in the Department of Political Science. He is a political theorist with an interest in ethnographic methods. His research focuses on how the state is experienced by those who interact with it and those who act in its name. His first book, “When the State Meets the Street (Harvard University Press, 2017),”&amp;nbsp;probes the everyday moral life of street-level bureaucrats. His second book project, “Institutional Atmospherics,” looks at several episodes in the 20th century when welfare agencies turned to architecture and interior design to try to repair their relationship to citizens, and recovers from that history a more ambitious conception of what an interface between state and society can and should do. He received his PhD from the Department of Government at Harvard University. He has been a fellow of the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin and is currently on sabbatical at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
